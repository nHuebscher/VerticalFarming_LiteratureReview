Hydroponic CEA systems use circa 15 kWh of electricity for lighting, cooling, ventilation and pumping per kg of lettuce supplied. Based on typical current national grid electricity generation mixes with significant fossil fuel dependence, this results in large environmental footprints, e.g. up to 17.8 kg CO2 eq. and 33 g N eq. per kg lettuce – compared with 10 kg CO2 eq. and 16 g N eq. per kg lettuce air-freighted across continents. However, hydroponic CEA can produce orders of magnitude more produce per m2.yr and can be integrated into existing buildings (e.g. on roof tops, in basements and disused warehouses, etc). Factoring in the carbon opportunity costs of land use, and meeting electricity requirements exclusively through renewable generation, could result in closed hydroponic CEA delivering produce with a smaller carbon footprint than most field-based supply chains, at 0.48 kg CO2 eq. per kg lettuce. However, this would only be the case where renewable electricity originates from genuinely additional capacity, and where a land use policy or other mechanisms ensure that modest areas of land spared from horticultural production are used for “nature based solutions” such as afforestation. Hydroponic CEA uses orders of magnitude less direct water than field-based systems, and could help to mitigate water stress and associated soil degradation in arid and semi-arid regions used for horticulture – so long as upstream water stress associated with electricity generation is mitigated. CEA could be one of the least sustainable forms of food production if poorly implemented, and has numerous environmental hotspots. But with careful design and scaling, in appropriate contexts of high demand and low agro-climatic potential for production of horticultural produce, CEA deployment could play a role in sustainable food system transformation, potentially helping to reconnect consumers with (urban) producers. There may be opportunities to link building air handling systems with rooftop or basement CEA requiring inputs of cooling, CO2 and water.","2022-10-01","2023-08-16 15:40:11","2023-09-24 14:39:37","2023-08-16 15:39:25","133214","","","369","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","New4","","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/ISQL5JZE/Casey et al. - 2022 - Comparative environmental footprints of lettuce su.pdf; /home/nele/Zotero/storage/KQAZ2U35/S0959652622028013.html","","","Carbon footprint; Food miles; Supply chain; Urban agriculture; Vertical farming; Water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these new farming methods is vertical farming. To understand the contribution of vertical farms to future sustainable food production, beyond its efficient land-use and high yields, this paper evaluates the current carbon footprint of lettuce produced in an operational vertical farm in comparison to conventional open-field farming and both soil-based and hydroponic greenhouse cultivation in the Netherlands. The assessment includes the greenhouse gas emissions of the life cycle of the farm and the crop, from cradle-to-grave. An alternative scenario is explored to include the lost carbon sequestration potential by land-use change, identical packaging for all farming methods, and renewable energy usage. The carbon footprint of the vertical farm was 5.6–16.7 times greater than that of the conventional farming methods in the baseline scenario and 2.3 to 3.3 times in the alternative scenario. The electricity demands of the vertical farm represented 85% of the carbon footprint in the baseline scenario and 66% in the alternative sce­ nario, suggesting that a significant reduction in electricity use is required to compete with conventional farming methods from a carbon footprint perspective. If this could be achieved, vertical farming could become a valid component of future sustainable and food secure systems by its efficient use of land, high yields, minimal use of water, nutrients, pesticides and herbicides, and the ability to be located within or adjacent to cities.","2022-12","2023-08-18 09:46:10","2023-09-24 14:39:22","2023-08-18 09:46:10","134443","","","377","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","New3","","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/CTGTBEMT/Blom et al. - 2022 - The embodied carbon emissions of lettuce productio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a number of social aspects of a newly established indoor urban farm in Stockholm. The farm was the result of a project created by commercial, civil society and municipal actors with the aim to make use of unused urban space, create jobs and produce food. While lettuce grown on the indoor farm emitted more GHG than lettuce cultivated outdoors in Sweden, it was more climate friendly than imported lettuce in our comparison. Furthermore, the indoor farm created value for the actors involved and for the city district, albeit on a small scale. Many of the positive environmental and social features owed to the small scale of the indoor farm and the context in which it developed.

This framing reflects a decades-long debate between opposing worldviews around agricultural paradigms, and it has constrained conversations regarding the creation of a sustainable global food system. Globally, agricultural production is diverse, and outcomes are achieved via a combination of several production systems. However, emerging technologies over the past 10 years are now being applied across agricultural systems resulting in enabling novel approaches to production. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of integrating emerging technologies and food production approaches (e.g., digital agriculture, genomic innovations, cellular agriculture, hydroponic farming) and coupling these with industrial and urban design principles (e.g., industrial ecology, mixed-use densification). We characterize a high-yield, local (HYL) agriculture approach, which involves shorter supply chains, decentralized control of the food system, and potentially reduced land use as well as a lower environmental footprint. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the HYL approach will vary depending on the geographical and place-based contexts in which it is implemented. It identifies key policy opportunities and considerations for ensuring HYL agriculture can support transitions to sustainable food systems, including climate change mitigation, habitat and biodiversity conservation, safety and nutrition standards, public communications, and labour and economy., resulting in a novel element to be incorporated into the ‘portfolio’ of agricultural strategies.","2023-06-01","2023-08-18 10:17:48","2023-09-24 14:39:56","2023-08-18 10:17:46","613-627","","3","15","","Food Sec.","Agriculture for the Anthropocene","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","New5","","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/R3Y4NEJ4/Newman et al. - 2023 - Agriculture for the Anthropocene novel applicatio.pdf","","","Agricultural paradigms; Agricultural technologies; Local agriculture; Policy; Sustainable food systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the recognition of the impacts of climate change on food security, there has been a greater uptake of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to provide climate‐resilient and high‐quality production. Vertical farming (VF) can allow primary production in urban locations as well as reducing seasonality and variability in produce. It is emerging as an alternative to traditional farming methods. This research aimed to explore the major environmental impacts of VF produce in comparison with conventional farming methods, using lettuce as an example crop. Life cycle analysis indicate that electricity consumption by VF account for 91% of the carbon footprint. Under the 2019 Scottish electricity mix, VF did not offer a viable competitor for UK open‐farmed lettuce or Spanish imports in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions (at approximately 1.49 kgCO2 eq. kg−1). However, with increasing use of renewable electricity in the national mix, by 2020, this had dropped to 0.42 kgCO2 eq. kg−1 making it comparable with UK open‐field agriculture (at approximately 0.46 kgCO2 eq. kg−1). Under a 100% renewable electricity generation scenario, VF‐related emissions drop further (to 0.33 kgCO2 eq. kg−1). This would potentially offer a low‐carbon production method not subject to seasonality which is better than that reported by most other production methods and offers higher water and nutrient efficiency. This research highlights green VF as potential alternative for sustainable future produce especially under changing climate scenarios. Life cycle analysis using lettuce as an example crop indicate that electricity consumption by VF account for 91% of the carbon footprint. Under the 2020 Scottish electricity mix, vertical farming was seen to be comparable with UK open‐field agriculture in environmental impacts. This lowers further under a 100% renewable electricity generation scenario, offer a low carbon production method and a potential alternative for sustainable future produce.","2023","2023-08-18 10:29:31","2023-09-24 14:39:12","","n/a","","2","12","","","Does green vertical farming offer a sustainable alternative to conventional methods of production?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","ec-europa-finder.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","New2","Place: Bognor Regis Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Inc","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/PC5ZYJBU/Sandison et al. - 2023 - Does green vertical farming offer a sustainable al.pdf","","","Agricultural practices; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Consumption; Electricity; Electricity consumption; Emissions; Environmental impact; Farm buildings; Farming; Food; Food security; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Imports; Lettuce; Life cycle; Life cycle analysis; Life cycles; Lighting; Methods; Primary production; Production methods; renewable energy; Seasonal variations; Seasonality; Sustainability; Traditional farming; Uptake; Urban areas; Vertical farming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are two systems, apparently diverging, recently considered as the counterparts of today’s conventional agricultural practice: organic farming (OF) and plant factories (PFs). With a strong regulatory background, OF integrates plant production into natural ecosystems by minimizing agrochemical use, while PFs create an artificial environment where all factors can be fine-tuned according to the needs of the crop. In this study, both systems are investigated based on their similarities and constraints; for this, three pillars of production were selected as indicators and reviewed for sustainability based on literature data: I. regulatory background, II. growing media use, III. species use, along with certain socio-economic factors. The reasons for co-existence were highlighted in every aspect. Alternatives for sustainable growing media use are introduced. PF-targeted species selection and variety breeding are necessary to maximize facility utilization. The main barriers to system interoperability are identified in growing media use and regulatory restrictions. The present global processes envisage the trends of the future, such as threats of living ecosystems, plant species allocation, urbanization impacts, agricultural intensification, economics of PFs, local supply chains, education about OF and PFs, consumer acceptance of OF and PF products, and discrepancies in global regulations.

Additionally, the conventional use of arable land is becoming increasingly difficult, which is further exacerbated by climate change. Soilless cultivation systems do not only offer the opportunity to save water and cultivate without soil but also the chance to open up urban areas such as residential rooftops for food production in close proximity to consumers. In this review, applications of soilless farming systems are identified and compared to conventional agriculture. Furthermore, aspects of economic viability, sustainability and current developments are investigated. An insight into the most important soilless farming systems—hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming—is provided. The systems are then differentiated from each other and, as far as possible, evaluated in terms of their environmental impact and compared with conventional cultivation methods. Comparing published data analyzing the yield of hydroponic cultivation systems in comparison to soil-based cultivation methods enables a basic overview of the profitability of both methods and, thus, lays the foundation for future research and practical applications. The most important inert substrates for hydroponic applications are presented, and their degree of sustainability is compared in order to emphasize environmental impacts and affect substrate selections of future projects. Based on an assessment of the most important soilless cultivation systems, the challenges and developments of current techniques are highlighted and discussed.","2022","2023-09-23 15:58:04","2023-09-24 08:27:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","73","","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/9Y7BQJUE/Fussy und Papenbrock - 2022 - An overview of soil and soilless cultivation techn.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comprehensive Life Cycle Analysis on the environmental impact of a vertical farm compared to …","","","","","http://essay.utwente.nl/83529/","It is expected that the population of the earth will keep rising in the coming decades, surpassing 9 billion in 2050. This rise in population causes pressure on agricultural land and food production, as well as global warming and resource depletion. In order to mitigate all these problems, food production per unit area has to be maximized and be as efficient and non-polluting as possible. Revolutionary techniques such as technological advancements in rural agriculture, greenhouses and urban agriculture are being studied to find possible solutions to the major problems at hand. One of these techniques in urban agriculture is called Vertical Farming (VF) - the urban farming of eatable crops inside a building with an ideal climate regulated by (semi) closed loop systems – and is believed to be the perfect solution to both the agricultural food problems and the climate change and resource depletion problems. To test this theory, this study creates and analyzes a fictive vertical farm in the state of Oklahoma USA, based on the local climate characteristics and peer-reviewed sources on vertical farming systems. With the use of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), the environmental impacts of the lettuce production in this farm are calculated and the results are compared to the rural agriculture of the same crop (located in California USA). This study shows that most of the claims made on the technique of vertical farming are in fact true. A vertical farm has a higher yield than rural agriculture, with more than 80 times the yield of open field agriculture, due to multiple harvests a year and a higher plant density, has a lower water footprint, with 18 times less water used, due to the semi-closed loop water system, has a lower freshwater pollution rate, with a eutrophication reduction of 70-90%, due to minor use of excessive fertilizers and has a major decrease in transport distance and thus a decrease CO2 emissions during transport. However, due to the large electricity demand to keep all high-end systems running in a VF, the CO2 emissions of a vertical farm are actually higher than that of rural agriculture. In fact, this high electricity use causes a lot of spikes in the graphs of almost all impact category, especially in the Terrestrial Acidification and the Land Footprint. Contrary to many beliefs, stating that the Land Footprint is only linked to the surface area in relation to plant density ratio, the Vertical Farm actually has a massive Land Footprint, due to the fact that electricity production and other production steps in the LCA also require a lot of land use. The results demonstrate that a Vertical Farm, just like any other agriculture technique, has its positives and negatives. Even though, it can help solve problems such as large food shortages and minimal water use, it has negative impacts elsewhere, in this case on land footprint, acidification of the ground and climate change. This study highlights the whole framework of a vertical farm and its characteristics, the positives and negatives of vertical farming and the importance of analyzing every step in a life cycle of a product or system. The thesis concludes by addressing the possibility of more efficient crop lay-outs and sustainable systems as well as the vertical farm’s potential in other fields of study such as extreme climates and aerospace.","2020","2023-09-23 15:58:04","2023-09-24 08:28:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","218","Publisher: essay.utwente.nl","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/MB7P4U3L/Wildeman - 2020 - Vertical farming a future perspective or a mere c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the observed, adverse impacts on wheat yields of climate change and the importance of wheat in the human diet, the purpose of this study was to use life cycle assessment to compare conventional wheat farming with indoor vertical farming using hydroponics. Methods: Life Cycle Assessment was used to assess the base case systems up to the “farm gate” for 1 tonne of wheat grain. The processes contributing most of the impacts were identified, and scenarios were assessed to determine how much the impacts could be reduced. Results: The conventional system outperformed the base case vertical system in every impact category, due to the electricity consumption in the lighting system. The scenarios included increasing the efficiency of the LED lighting and using 100% wind energy, but the conventional system still outperformed the vertical system by significant margins in all impact categories. This was due to the low photosynthetic conversion efficiency and the high energy density of wheat. Conclusions: Until significant improvements are made to lighting efficiency, the photosynthesis conversion efficiency of wheat, new wheat variants designed for vertical gardens and the sustainability of electricity supply, conventional wheat production will be environmentally preferable and vertical gardens would be advised to focus on food products with low energy densities.","2021","2023-09-23 15:58:04","2023-09-24 08:34:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","350","Publisher: preprints.org","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/ZNA5U53Z/Sørensen et al. - 2021 - Comparing the Environmental Sustainability of Vert.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contribution illustrates the basics of traditional gardening and farming approaches and describes how their characteristics are adapted in innovative modern farming systems like aquaponic, permaculture, urban farming, as well as recovered traditional farming systems. The approach to combine traditional farming methods with modern ones will provide multiple benefits in the future to ensure food security. There is to be underlined that such a strategy holds a substantial potential of circular flux management in small scale food production. This potential could be transposed to a larger scale also, particularly in terms of agroforestry and integrated plant and animal husbandry or integrated agriculture and aquaculture.

Current knowledge suggests that, although apparently opposite, organic and high-tech soilless cultivation have several common or converging points in view of a sustainable use of resources on the planet.

Addressing the lack of comprehensive comparisons between different controlled-environment agriculture systems on a consistent basis, this work investigates the favourability of indoor vertical farms (i.e. plant factories) over modern ventilated open and closed greenhouses from an energy intensity perspective. This was based on a flexible yield-energy model incorporating detailed air conditioning system dynamics, which was developed to evaluate the influence of outside climate conditions on energy consumption and vegetable yield. The model was used to optimise the climate control strategy and to minimise hourly specific energy consumption for multiple systems, parameter settings, and locations. The hourly model performance is demonstrated for Stockholm, which indicates that advanced climate control allows for very low-energy operations in summer compared to winter. The results show a strong parametric sensitivity for the thermal transmittance of the cover, the target light intensity and the crop climate preference in all three systems, as well as the efficiency of lighting and water cooling for plant factories. Considering the yearly average for multiple locations, open greenhouses were substantially more energy-efficient than plant factories in all ten locations (from −45% in Reykjavík to −94% in Gauteng). The option to ventilate a greenhouse (open vs closed) had the greatest positive effect on specific energy consumption in less extreme climates (from −36% in Massachusetts to −83% in Gauteng) but increased water consumption considerably (from an average of ~2 l/kg to 26 l/kg). Although local availability of land and water plays a significant role in the choice between growing systems, the results imply that high-tech ventilated greenhouses perform significantly better than vertical farms from an energy perspective in most inhabited regions of the planet.

This work compares traditional farming with greenhouses and indoor vertical farming focusing on the challenges and the opportunities for each category. The scope of this work was to stress the role of indoor vertical farming towards this direction. Indoor vertical farms can produce high quality and virus-free products that can be locally distributed, inside the urban environment that such investments take place, saving annually millions of tons CO2 emissions. Beyond that, in this work it was pointed out how energy plays a role in food safety in such systems. It was stressed that indoor vertical farms can act as a demand response aggregator. In large scale units it could play a role to adjust their production according to different electricity prices offered in different time zones throughout the day. This way, the owners under a multi-value business model will create the opportunity to the vertical farm owners not only to improve their production but at the same time absorb inexpensive electricity offered, by creating an additional profit mechanism (multiple revenue streams) under such an approach by entering into contracts with companies in a utility electric region.

Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create tradeoffs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind. Overall, strong good governance is needed at multiple levels, combining top-down and bottom-up processes.

While the overall potential of UA to contribute to sustainable urban development has been extensively investigated, comprehensive analyses comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the various forms of UA are still scarce. In particular, the use of life cycle analysis (LCA) in quantifying the ecological sustainability of UA provides useful data for decision-making processes. The aim of this thesis is to close some of these research gaps by contributing to the emerging discourse on UA in the global north, with a focus on the city of Vienna, Austria. Different methodological approaches are combined in order to provide a comprehensive and detailed picture of the multifunctional potential of the analysed forms of UA. Important sustainability aspects and challenges to consider are shown: (i) a typology of seven relevant ideal-typical forms of UA in Europe is developed, systematically describing and comparing their concepts, goals and effects, as well as resource, energy and spatial requirements. (ii) On this basis, a systematic, multi-criteria sustainability assessment is carried out for each of the seven forms of UA. Starting with a comprehensive literature review, 39 sustainability indicators are defined, individually assessed and discussed with experts. In a third step (iii), an LCA is conducted to analyse the carbon footprint of 1 kg tomatoes from community garden projects in Vienna, a rooftop garden (RTG) and a project on a field (FP). The system boundary encompasses impacts from raw material extraction to the point of consumption and discerned four stages: substrate production, infrastructure, fertilizer management and soil tillage. The evaluated UA forms reach between 16 and 41% of the potential maximum urban sustainability value and form two clusters: (i) forms with a multifunctional character: community gardens and farms (37-41%) with potential benefits on social (e.g. community building and education), ecological (e.g. green infrastructure and recycling of organic urban waste) and economic (e.g. savings at the household level and establishment of alternative operating models) levels; and (ii) forms with more specific strengths: technically innovative forms of cultivation (16-18%) (e.g. food production, job creation as well as research and innovation). The differences are mainly due to the degree of multifunctionality along the analysed sustainability aspects. As the low overall values indicate, there is room for improvement as well as possible barriers and risks for all analysed forms of UA. The carbon footprints of the two case studies show considerable differences: compared to the FP system (60 g CO2e/kg of product), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the tomatoes produced in the RTG system are almost four times higher (221 g CO2e/kg of product). The difference is mainly caused by the use of compost substrate in the RTG system, which alone exceeds the total emissions of FP tomatoes by a factor of 2.3, thus representing a significant GHG hotspot in the production of RTG tomatoes. The results are within the range of comparable urban and organic production systems, which indicates that community-based UA projects – in addition to their socio-ecological benefits – could play a vital role in mitigating GHG emissions related to urban fruit and vegetable consumption in Vienna. With a comprehensive understanding of how the different forms of UA potentially contribute to overcoming major socio-ecological challenges in cities (such as the climate crisis and increasing urbanization) the present study can support urban policy-makers and stakeholders in integrating UA into city-wide development strategies and planning tools.","2020","2023-09-23 15:58:04","2023-09-24 09:21:02","","","","1 cites: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6924869766268133818&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=2007&hl=en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1185","Publisher: researchgate.net","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/I23HMJUW/Dietl - 2020 - Wie Städte von urbaner Landwirtschaft profitieren .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organic is more rural and farming related, while urban agriculture is innovation with same targets (healthy and sustainable food production) and apart from farm land (e.g. in-door, balcony, vertical, container, hydro, roof, cellar). Both of these food chain innovation are like-minded but rarely exchange ideas and results. Novel foods mushrooms, invertebrates, algae) and food habits (vegan, vegetarian, etc.) are popular in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture is very efficient in space (yield per m2) and nutrients (nearly 100%, closed systems). Organic can learn a lot about those ideas and results. Vis-a-versa, urban agriculture is limited in mass production, usually high-tech related with a lot of energy and technology needs.

Producing crops in (peri-)urban areas shows good potential to provide the vegetable products for a healthy and balanced diet for the growing population, but it has to deal with the local availability of resources. Thus, meeting the food requirements of the urban population as efficiently and robustly as possible is a challenge. This study developed a methodology to estimate the use of resources of urban farming systems to produce energy- and nutrient-dense vegetables capable of meeting human dietary needs. The method was applied to two extremely different cultivation systems (an open field farm and a plant factory with artificial lighting) for the production of seven crops. The results on the resource efficiencies to meet the annual per-capita vegetable requirements are discussed in relation to crop type, local climate and cultivation system. The application of this methodology can support farmers' decisions on the choice of crops and the type of urban farming systems that are most efficient in contributing to a plant-based diet. The results can also be translated into water, energy, and surface area needed to meet the nutritional requirements at a city-regional level.","2023-04-25","2023-09-25 06:48:28","2023-09-25 06:49:03","","","","","","","Food and Energy Security","Resources for plant‐based food","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","New8","","","/home/nele/Zotero/storage/GYI8V8XK/Righini et al. - 2023 - Resources for plant‐based food Estimating resourc.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370281010_Resources_for_plant-based_food_Estimating_resource_use_to_meet_the_requirements_of_urban_and_peri-urban_diets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its efficacy depends on several variables, including the type of UA and the geographical location of the city.

The results show that the hydroponic farm performs better than cultivations in heated greenhouses, and similarly to conventional open field farms.
