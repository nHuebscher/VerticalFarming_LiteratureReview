AB  - Over the past decades, various farming methods have evolved in response to the global challenges of increasing food demands, decreasing availability of arable land, and climate change. One of these new farming methods is vertical farming. To understand the contribution of vertical farms to future sustainable food production, beyond its efficient land-use and high yields, this paper evaluates the current carbon footprint of lettuce produced in an operational vertical farm in comparison to conventional open-field farming and both soil-based and hydroponic greenhouse cultivation in the Netherlands. The assessment includes the greenhouse gas emissions of the life cycle of the farm and the crop, from cradle-to-grave. An alternative scenario is explored to include the lost carbon sequestration potential by land-use change, identical packaging for all farming methods, and renewable energy usage. The carbon footprint of the vertical farm was 5.6–16.7 times greater than that of the conventional farming methods in the baseline scenario and 2.3 to 3.3 times in the alternative scenario. The electricity demands of the vertical farm represented 85% of the carbon footprint in the baseline scenario and 66% in the alternative scenario, suggesting that a significant reduction in electricity use is required to compete with conventional farming methods from a carbon footprint perspective. If this could be achieved, vertical farming could become a valid component of future sustainable and food secure systems by its efficient use of land, high yields, minimal use of water, nutrients, pesticides and herbicides, and the ability to be located within or adjacent to cities.

AB  - As the global population expands and food demand increases, the agricultural sector faces increased duress for better yield production. Furthermore, agricultural land is already lost due to urbanization infrastructure advancement, leading to farmland shortages. The artificial control of light, temperature, gases, and humidity allows indoor plant production. Vertical farming’s primary goal is to maximize crop output in a small space. Vertical farming has the potential to produce food in a climate-resilient manner while emitting no pesticides and fertilizers, additionally using reduced land and water than conventional farming. Vertical farming systems, particularly around heavily populated areas, can meet everyday consumer needs for fresh, nutritious products and, at the same time, also contribute to resilient food systems. This system at present grows a narrow crop range, such as vegetables, herbs, and fruits. However, successful vertical farming integration into conventional agriculture demands profitability improvement, efficient energy utilization, end-user acceptance, and communal policy. In the present chapter, vertical farming is discussed as an indoor multilayer crop production system, investigating future challenges in the area of plant growth, quality, environmental sustainability, automation, system control, and socioeconomic and policy-associated institutions must collaborate to make certain successful vertical farming and organic farming integration into future food systems.

AB  - Producing food in an environmentally sustainable way for the growing human population is a challenge to the global food system. Vertical farm (VF) as a part of the solution portfolio is attracting interest since it uses less water, pesticides, and land which are scarce in many parts of the globe. Despite these positive factors, the energy demand for vertical farms is high, and farms often remain separate and excluded from cities where most of the population lives. City-level energy system solutions exist to empower energy efficiency and increase the share of variable renewable energy sources, but their potential has not yet been estimated for an urban energy system that includes large vertical farms. Accordingly, in this study, we simulate an urban energy system that practices vertical farming with large-scale variable renewable energies and flexibility measures. For the first part of the study, we modelled a vertical farm's energy system with demand response control to maximize electricity cost savings. To evaluate the potential of demand response, the analysis is carried out for different crops (lettuce, wheat, and soybean), and different electricity price profiles. The result of demand response control can be a reduction of 5% to 30% in electricity consumption costs. Further, sensitivity analyses highlight the effect of electricity price variations and photoperiod on demand response outcomes. In the second part, the operation of an urban energy system (Helsinki, Finland) with vertical farms was analysed through two different scenarios. These scenarios represent the emission-free Helsinki energy system in 2050 with large-scale wind power implementation. As VFs can use electricity outside the peak demand hours, the inclusion of VF with the right energy system configuration can improve the power consumption within the system by up to 19%. Further, we show that connection to the exogenous power market is important to support vertical farming in the future energy systems. In this study, key points in the integration of VF in urban energy systems are highlighted, including the role of exogenous power markets, the potential for increasing local energy consumption with large wind power, and the importance of crop selection in reducing VF's energy costs through demand response. In a city-level solution with a high wind power share, we thus recommend including a vertical farm side by strong sectoral coupling as part of the future design to maximise local consumption.

AB  - The trend to localise food production promises reduced reliance on increasingly uncertain global supply chains. Controlled-environment agriculture, in particular indoor vertical farming, is developing as part of this trend, to ensure a year-round supply of healthy food and protection from extreme weather events. However, high energy consumption is a major concern that could greatly impact the environmental sustainability of high-tech farms. Addressing the lack of comprehensive comparisons between different controlled-environment agriculture systems on a consistent basis, this work investigates the favourability of indoor vertical farms (i.e. plant factories) over modern ventilated open and closed greenhouses from an energy intensity perspective. This was based on a flexible yield-energy model incorporating detailed air conditioning system dynamics, which was developed to evaluate the influence of outside climate conditions on energy consumption and vegetable yield. The model was used to optimise the climate control strategy and to minimise hourly specific energy consumption for multiple systems, parameter settings, and locations. The hourly model performance is demonstrated for Stockholm, which indicates that advanced climate control allows for very low-energy operations in summer compared to winter. The results show a strong parametric sensitivity for the thermal transmittance of the cover, the target light intensity and the crop climate preference in all three systems, as well as the efficiency of lighting and water cooling for plant factories. Considering the yearly average for multiple locations, open greenhouses were substantially more energy-efficient than plant factories in all ten locations (from −45% in Reykjavík to −94% in Gauteng). The option to ventilate a greenhouse (open vs closed) had the greatest positive effect on specific energy consumption in less extreme climates (from −36% in Massachusetts to −83% in Gauteng) but increased water consumption considerably (from an average of ~2 l/kg to 26 l/kg). Although local availability of land and water plays a significant role in the choice between growing systems, the results imply that high-tech ventilated greenhouses perform significantly better than vertical farms from an energy perspective in most inhabited regions of the planet.

AB  - Urban farming can improve cities’ food security and resilience, but the performance of different farming systems with respect to land and investment constraints has not been systematically investigated. Here, we compared conventional soil-based farming, vertical farming with natural lighting (Vnat), and indoor vertical farming. This study aimed to compare (1) the dynamic production of leafy vegetables over time given the same amount of investment and land constraints, (2) the associated water and energy use, and (3) the global warming potential (GWP) of the urban farming sector if each of the three farming systems was solely used in the tropical city-state of Singapore. A system dynamics (SD) model was constructed to map the potential quantity of leafy vegetables produced, together with the water and energy use of each farming system. The land and monetary investment constraints were set at an additional 0.3% of the total land area of Singapore and an annual investment of SGD 10–20 million (0.001–0.005% of Singapore's annual GDP). Vnat farming was predicted to have the highest production level (110,000 t) and self-sufficiency (76.9% of total demand) by 2050 based on the SD model. This would be >3 times the self-sufficiency level achieved by indoor and soil-based farming systems given the same investment and land constraints. Indoor farming was simulated to use <14% the land area of Vnat while soil-based farming exhausted the additional 0.3% of the land allocated. Indoor farming was also the most energy intensive system, requiring 100 times more than Vnat farming. Comparison of the GHG emission rates showed that indoor farming had the greatest GWP—at 2.51 kg CO2-eq per kg of lettuce produced. Our results suggest that Vnat farming may be the best form of urban farming system to provide large amounts of food in Singapore, considering the production level, the amount of resources used, and the environmental impacts.

AB  - Food safety is an important scientific field, but at the same time a discussion topic of modern society that occupies more and more space of our every day time, dealing with the preparation of food, with its nutritious value, and various transportation and storage ways aiming at preventing food-related sickness. This work compares traditional farming with greenhouses and indoor vertical farming focusing on the challenges and the opportunities for each category. The scope of this work was to stress the role of indoor vertical farming towards this direction. Indoor vertical farms can produce high quality and virus-free products that can be locally distributed, inside the urban environment that such investments take place, saving annually millions of tons CO2 emissions. Beyond that, in this work it was pointed out how energy plays a role in food safety in such systems. It was stressed that indoor vertical farms can act as a demand response aggregator. In large scale units it could play a role to adjust their production according to different electricity prices offered in different time zones throughout the day. This way, the owners under a multi-value business model will create the opportunity to the vertical farm owners not only to improve their production but at the same time absorb inexpensive electricity offered, by creating an additional profit mechanism (multiple revenue streams) under such an approach by entering into contracts with companies in a utility electric region.

AB  - In recent years, Urban and peri-urban farming (UPF) research has experienced significant growth, but a comprehensive global overview is lacking. This study examined UPF research from 2002 to 2022 using an integrated literature review approach, including systematic literature review, bibliometric analysis, and thematic assessment. Analyzing 1,257 articles from the Web of Science database with Vosviewer and Bibliometrix, key keywords identified in the literature were urban agriculture, food security, local food systems, community gardens, and sustainable agriculture. Prominent research trends included the Internet of Things (IoT), resilience, Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), plant factories, Life cycle assessment (LCA), and vertical farming. Publications by US-affiliated authors received higher citations, and co-authorship collaborations from China, India, and Brazil were observed in UPF research network. Notable institutions with significant contributions and collaboration links in UPF research were the University Autonoma de Barcelona, the University of Kassel, and the National University of Singapore. This study's findings offer valuable insights for researchers and policymakers in the food and agriculture industry, providing a comprehensive overview of the UPF domain and suggesting future research directions. This review advances urban farming practices, informing decision-making processes, research priorities and developing the policies and initiatives to foster resilient and sustainable urban farming.

AB  - Indoor vertical farming (VF) may play an important role in tackling future food insecurity as it can reduce the land use requirements for crop land and is not affected by environmental conditions. However, its energy-intensive operation and the associated environmental impacts can be a cause for concern. To alleviate these issues, it is desirable to operate VF with renewable energy. Our aim was to investigate the land use requirements for generating renewable energy for VF and whether the land area saved by growing crops in multiple layers is sufficient for energy production. The land area requirements for wind and solar (photovoltaic, PV) energy were assessed for lettuce, tomato, potato and wheat production in VF systems in Spain and Sweden. In addition to current-technology scenarios, future scenarios for technological advancement in VF systems and renewable energy generation were included. The results showed that with current technologies, the saved land area was sufficient to produce enough energy only in the case of using PV for lettuce production. However, with improved technologies, the saved land area was sufficient to produce electricity with PV for all crops except tomatoes in Sweden. In contrast, wind energy only satisfies lettuce production, even with future technologies. This study serves as a guideline for determining the feasibility of VF operated with renewable energy in relation to land area, electricity requirements and renewable electricity generation potential in various regions of Europe.

AB  - Attitude measurement occupies a central position in consumer research. Concerns over the validity and reliability of traditional measures have motivated the development of alternative approaches. The present research introduces text highlighting as a method for measurement of explicit attitudes using a case study on vertical farming (VF) with 837 UK consumers. They participated in an online survey, where they read a text about VF and used highlighting functions to mark text as ‘like’ and ‘dislike.’ Consumers approached the task in a systematic and logical way and desirable aspects of VF were frequently highlighted as ‘like’, whereas undesirable aspects were more frequently highlighted as ‘dislike’. The text highlighting responses were summarised using word clouds, frequency tables and through sentiment scores to reveal an overall positive attitude to VF among participants. Sentiment scores enabled the identification of consumer segments with interpretable differences in their attitude towards VF. Two approaches to method validation – comparison with direct attitude questions and consumer profiling – further confirmed the potential of the text highlighting method. The sentiment of specific sentences in the text highlighting task matched results from self-reported attitudinal based on Likert scales. Consumer segments with different sentiment in the text highlighting task also differed in their food technology neophobia scores in the expected direction. Future research should investigate methodological aspects of text highlighting and explore its suitability to other applications.

AB  - This chapter deals with the application of vertical farming systems on building facades and their contribution to food security and reduction of carbon footprint in urban areas. These systems have the advantage of using already built surfaces and sunlight in contrast to indoor-controlled environment that consumes valuable space and electricity for lighting and air-conditioning. The aim is to conduct a summary review of vertical farming systems on facades and to highlight their various social, economic and environmental benefits. This is supported by a selection of case studies and actual implementations in diverse latitudes where different technologies are applied to residential, office and commercial buildings achieving various levels of productivity. The concept of productive façade systems and their implementation at the Tropical Technologies Laboratory of the National University of Singapore is explained more in detail. The results of the experiments are promising in terms of the contribution of vertical farming systems on facades to food security and urban resilience. However, further studies and pilot projects are needed, as well as an extensive multidisciplinary cooperation, to overcome some of the operational limitations and to increase the acceptability, thus helping widespread implementation of vertical farming on facades.

AB  - The production and consumption of food are responsible for serious environmental degradation. Given the nature of the global economy, the impacts of food are dispersed over the full extent of the planet because food commodities may travel long distances from production to consumption. In this Primer, we introduce the principles of life cycle assessment (LCA), which allows for the assessment of the global extent of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a product system. We describe how LCA works following the standard phases of (1) goal and scope, (2) life cycle inventory, (3) life cycle impact assessment, and (4) interpretation. We show that LCA studies can capture the environmental impacts of foods, diets, and food production systems. While LCA has been expanding in scope and breadth, collaboration across disciplines is needed to further capture the diversity of food systems and to better deal with underassessed foods.

AB  - The increasing population and continuous urbanization make food security prominent in sustainable development. It is important to develop economic and resource-efficient farming solutions to meet food demand. Renewable energy and waste valorization may bring benefits to build sustainable food production systems and facilitate circular economy. This work aims to develop a decision support framework for the stakeholders to quantitatively assess and optimize their urban farming systems for efficient investment and operation. The proposed framework is based on a holistic system model that considers the energy and material consumption in vegetable production processes and the economic and environmental performance of urban farming systems. In the multi-dimensional assessment model, the net present value and cradle-to-gate CO2 emission, water consumption, and land occupation of different configurations of urban farming systems were assessed. In a further development, the assessment model was embedded in an optimization framework to identify the optimal system design and operation. The optimal crop mix and the corresponding cultivation set points (such as temperature, humidity, irradiance, illumination time, and CO2 concentration) for the farming modules were determined via optimization. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on the design and operation of a vertical farm in Singapore was carried out. The case study examined alternative farming systems with glass-enclosed vs window-free structural design, grid vs solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, and traditional chemical fertilizers vs food waste compost fertilization. Results showed that plant-factory farming systems integrated with solar PV and beer-residue-derived fertilizer could be a promising and sustainable farming solution for Singapore as a tropical megacity.

T2  - Computers and Electronics in Agriculture
AB  - Plant factory can provide stable crop cultivation environment, shorten cultivation duration, and deliver better produce quality by controlling temperature, humidity, lighting, nutrient supply, and other cultivating factors. Due to the high cost of operation, how to select crops and plan the cultivation schedule to enhance profitability is an important issue. In this research, the plant factory scheduling problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The objective function is to seek the maximum revenue by considering several practical operating conditions such as (1) crop market value per unit and time, (2) crop adjacency issue, (3) cleaning and maintenance, and (4) sunlight blocking by solar panel on the roof. Although the scheduling problem can be solved by the optimization solver, it presents challenges of rack-level modification when applying the optimization method on the field. Therefore, this study further developed a heuristic algorithm, named Heuristic Plant Factory Scheduler (HPFS), which applies a recursive technique to schedule crops rack by rack. This approach provides ease of implementation and modification. The experimental results show that HPFS is able to accelerate the computational performance with acceptable scheduling quality when the problem space is large.

AB  - A comprehensive analysis of multiple aspects of food production is needed to address related concerns, such as the use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, the consumption of water, the occupation or transformation of land, and greenhouse gas emissions. We examine the environmental properties of plant factories with sunlight and plant factories with artificial light, comparing them with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. Process conditions and inventory data were extracted from demonstration factories in Chiba, Japan. We found that these plant factories reduced the use of irreplaceable resources for food production, i.e., phosphorus, water, and land area, at the expense of additional energy consumption compared with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. By employing emerging energy technology options, energy consumption can be reduced sufficiently to be competitive with that of conventional horticulture systems. The results indicate that plant factories could become a viable or competitive production technology, changing the slope factors in the nexus of food, energy, and water systems.

AB  - This chapter introduces to sustainable agriculture (SA), which is seen as a necessary way to feed and maintain/improve the quality of life of a growing world population without exacerbating environmental degradation. It starts by recalling the general importance of agriculture and showing the diversity and heterogeneity of agriculture forms around the world along with their disparities and problems faced. It then underlines the core of SA, and demonstrates several possible pathways toward SA, including organic farming, integrated farming, ecological and sustainable intensification, conservation, climate-smart and precision agriculture, permaculture and vertical farming. By the end of the chapter, the challenges for the main actors involved in building sustainability of agriculture, that is, science, education, policy-makers, and farmers, were summarized.

AB  - It has been a challenge to support the expansion of urban agriculture (UA) in cities due to its poor economic profitability. However, it is also hard to deny the increasing benefits of UA in improving the socio-environmental dimension of cities. Hence, in this review, different aspects of UA were examined to highlight its value beyond profitability such as social, health and well-being, disaster risk reduction, and environmental perspectives. A case study and relevant policies were analyzed to determine how policy makers can bridge the gap between current and future UA practices and sustainable development. Bridging these policy gaps can help the UA sector to sustainably grow and become successfully integrated in cities. Moreover, advancements in UA technologies and plant biotechnology were presented as potential solutions in increasing the future profitability of commercial UA. Consequently, as new UA-related technologies evolve, the multidisciplinary nature of UA and its changing identity from agriculture to digital technology, similarly require adaptive policies. These policies should maximize the potential of UA in contributing to resiliency and sustainability and incentivize the organic integration of UA in cities, while equally serving social justice.

AB  - Since 2010, advances in scientific knowledge and innovative agricultural technology have revitalized urban agriculture (UA) into innovative urban agriculture (IUA). The continuous intensification of IUA could lead to a Second Green Revolution, which aims to meet the current and future food demand. Here, we review the emerging IUA practices and estimate the contribution of IUA to food security and environmental sustainability by limitedly comparing scientific literature and actual data of eighteen practitioners worldwide. The currently most productive IUA practice can produce up to 140 kg vegetables per m2/year. Various scales of IUA potentially contribute to global food security by supporting local food supply, strengthening the food value chain, and applying more sustainable practices than conventional agriculture. Further comprehensive life cycle assessments of IUA are needed, especially in developing countries, to prevent an increase of the environmental burden and to balance the interests of people, planet, and profit.

T3  - Wild urban ecosystems: challenges and opportunities for urban development
AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city’s green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35molm−2 d−1 under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and façades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by façade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north–south oscillation of the sun’s path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at façades, buildings with an east–west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings.

AB  - Electrification is a promising approach to most carbon-emitting sectors of economic sectors of human activities such as transportation and industry sectors. Electrifying the machinery and different systems used in a farm can mitigate the carbon footprint of the agriculture sector if renewable energy sources are coordinated with the agricultural loads appropriately. This paper presents a road-map that: 1) presents greenhouse gases emitting activities in the food supply chain, 2) the potential impact of vertical farming on the agriculture sector, 3) discuss the carbon footprint of different activities in the food supply chain, and 4) presents a road-map to decarbonize greenhouse gas emitting activities in farms. This paper estimates that electrification of farms in an appropriate process with renewable energy resources can decrease the carbon footprint of farming 44–70% depends on the type of the farm.

AB  - Agriculture faces huge challenges regarding sustainable use of soils and its sustainability performance in general. There are three different approaches to sustainable agricultural production commonly proposed, namely intensification, agro-ecological approaches and high-tech industrial approaches. Often, some propose that only agro-ecological approaches are truly sustainable options, with particular benefits for soil protection, while others argue that intensification or high-tech performs better through land sparing. In this viewpoint, we scrutinize the notion of “sustainable agricultural production” and the role these approaches may play for such, in particular addressing the controversy of “naturalness” versus “artificiality” in production systems. Consumers often perceive agriculture as “natural”, but agriculture today thrives always on strong human intervention. We posit that agriculture is linked to soils and natural processes, but that this provides little guidance on what sustainable agriculture should be. Being “natural” need not be an aspect of being sustainable. If it is, arguments for this need to be provided. Furthermore, revealed consumer preferences may much less frequently posit being “natural” as a central criterion for food consumed than usually assumed. By all this, we do not want to promote any of those three approaches uncritically. We rather argue for enlarging the option space for sustainable agriculture in an unprejudiced way.

AU  - Boix-Fayos, Carolina

T2  - Agricultural Systems
AB  - CONTEXT
Agriculture plays a central role in the European Green Deal with various policies and strategies converging to promote sustainable agriculture and food systems. The Farm to Fork strategy approaches agriculture from a sustainable food systems perspective. Sustainable agriculture is also central in the European Biodiversity strategy, in the Long-term vision for EU Rural areas and in the Soil strategy. Despite clear policy objectives, there is still a long way towards an effective transition towards sustainable agriculture based on integrated, science based, solutions.
OBJECTIVE
This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the challenges and opportunities for the transition towards a sustainable agriculture in Europe, the role of European policies and practical approaches.
METHODS
We reviewed policy documents, scientific literature and global data to reflect on the vision of the Farm to Fork and other European strategies affecting sustainable agriculture, focussing on which policy instruments are foreseen to reach their objectives, which are the key-challenges related to achieve more sustainable farming, and on possible approaches to attain sustainable agriculture.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We provide an overview of synergies and shared objectives between different European policies and strategies aiming to support the transition to sustainable agriculture from environmental, social and economic perspectives. We identified several often reported challenges to attain sustainable food systems: reduced yields, increased land demand, nitrogen needs, changes in diet, food waste, distribution and access to food, and externalities to third countries. Finally, we discuss two main approaches to sustainable agriculture with potential complementarity to fulfil the objectives of sustainable agriculture as reflected in the different European policies and strategies. Sustainable intensification with focus on environmental- friendly production, and agroecology with focus on ecology, social justice and food sovereignty. We reflect on how both approaches can be integrated to create synergies and optimize delivery of multiple ecosystem services. The transformation to sustainable agriculture, as expected from the several revised strategies, is not just a technical question of farming practices, but requires a holistic approach considering social, economic, cultural, technical and environmental aspects. Local adaptations, stakeholder participation, and recognition that agriculture produces more than crops, are key to support this transition of agriculture and food systems.
SIGNIFICANCE
The transition towards more sustainable agriculture requires alignment of policies related to social, economic and environmental aspects, including social and economic acknowledgment to farmers, as managers of agroecosystems and cultural landscapes delivering a range of ecosystem services.

AB  - The greenhouse sector has seen many advances to improve its resource demands, though little is known of the environmental impacts. This study aims to assess the environmental performance of a horticultural greenhouse in Sweden producing herbs. Life cycle assessment is employed to analyze different scenarios. These include previous measures, such as switching to organic fertilizers, a pellet burner, and reducing the packaging weight. Future scenarios are assessed, including increasing biofueled logistics, switching to LEDs, densifying production, and including recyclable packaging. The results suggest that GHG emissions were reduced by 32% per kg edible portion through past scenarios in current scenario. Additionally, densifying production and switching to LED lighting can lead to an additional 14% and 10% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the current system respectively, while also reducing other environmental impact categories. These results provide insights into the implications of environmental and resource improvement measures taken at greenhouses.

The issue of food sustainability transitions has sparked the interest of researchers due to food security being one of the greatest challenges of the new century. It is important to document that ensuring food security does not mean only a boost in food production, if not, it is something even more complex. The challenge includes the adaptation of eating habits and the implementation of new technologies and strategies that allow the food production system to be sustainable and environmentally friendly. A route with the purpose of securing natural resources while climate change is halted. This article shows a brief description of the actual situation of food security transitions considering transition strategies and the limitation caused by natural resources focused on water requirements.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - Agricultural systems that classify as ‘beyond organic’ have the potential to advance sustainability efforts. The present research considers these emerging systems from a consumer insights perspective. Using biodynamic (BD) agriculture as an exemplar, public opinions were explored in a multi-method and multi-national study with samples of consumers in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Singapore, and Germany. Across 1237 participants, the empirical findings pointed to largely positive attitudes. Between-country differences were minor, whereas consumer segmentation identified pan-national groups of people with attitudes that were, respectively, BD Positive (71%), BD Neutral (20%) or BD Negative (9%). In the BD Positive segment, consumers responded positively to the environmental and social aspects of BD agriculture, and it mattered to them that BD agriculture was a balanced and integrated approach to farming/food production. That is, they were not averse to the holistic/spiritual aspects that are unique to BD. Biodiversity, but also other aspects of environmental sustainability mattered more to consumers than social sustainability, notably worker welfare and community resilience. The research provides new consumer insights about biodynamics by being generic to BD agriculture rather than product specific (e.g., BD wine), and advances extant consumer research by jointly exploring environmental and social sustainability. Several practical implications emerge from the results.

AB  - As the adverse consequences of the industrial/modern agricultural framework, which encompasses high-input agrarian production and intensive cultivation, are increasing, an alternative is essential. Permaculture is a bunch of sustainable practices that incorporate an assortment of components and promote comprehensive and multi-polycultures including perennial plants, high degrees of biodiversity, crop-animal integration, whole watershed management, and self-sustaining on-site energy production, all of which straightforwardly affect the sustainable approach and promote ecological parameters. This case study attempts to better comprehend the local knowledge in terms of planning and fostering a permaculture system that considers their work, culture, and environmental concerns. In particular, this research focuses on the combined ideology, actual practices, and co-opting nature of three Nepalese permaculturists. The current study employs the notion of imaginaries to comprehend how permaculture may supplant the present agricultural system. Therefore, the study promotes and urges agricultural actioners to create profound and emotional associations with the planet, as well as their creativity and imagination, to impact good natural change.

AB  - The European Green Deal clearly declares the ambitious goal of making European food ‘the global standard for sustainability’ on the basis of an integrated approach encompassing all aspects of food supply chains. The Farm to Fork Strategy asserts that research and innovation are key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems, from primary production to consumption. Therefore, in this paper, the most promising fields of innovation towards this transition in the agrifood sector have been reviewed with reference to the value chain actors engaged in their implementation. Although not exhaustive, this short survey presents a selection of solutions that have in recent years been viewed as ‘first mover’ opportunities for innovation in the agrifood sector where changes have been initiated but need to be further implemented. The paper first discusses options that allow agrifood businesses to operate directly as innovation providers, and then expands on the role of public stakeholders, namely consumers, policy makers and researchers, to act as agents of change and contribute to pave the way to a ‘green deal’ in Europe. The survey concludes by highlighting the possibility of developing integrated approaches to research and innovation to ensure the sustainability of the food system through cooperative actions engaging both private and public actors in the value chain.

AB  - Global climate change and population growth are two key issues that are currently the subject of discussions around the world. Currently, there are around 7.5 billion people on the planet Earth, and it is estimated that the population will grow by over 12 billion, the majority of whom will be living in mega cities in 2100. This means we need to produce more agricultural food while the global temperature increases. Molecular agriculture, hydroponics, or aquaponics indoor production through sky farming and nursery businesses are among the current topics on feeding, the planet Earth. In this chapter, we revisit some sustainable systems and methods used in agriculture. Different strategies of sustainable agricultural systems and methods seek to develop a sustainable environment and food production to increase crop productivity and soil health. This reduce the impacts of global climate change, through the adaptation and building of crop resilience, as well as conserving biodiversity, capturing carbon in the soil, and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Sustainability can be defined as the avoidance of the depletion of natural resources to maintain an ecological balance at a certain rate and it finds its exact definition in the biological systems where there exists exchange, but no waste is produced. Sustainable agriculture can be defined as desired type of agricultural activity to supply society's food and textile needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. From this definition, it is clear to note that an agricultural system cannot be sustainable if it causes environmental damage. Therefore, the environmental sustainability of agriculture is related to the preservation, restoration, and improvement of all natural elements such as air, water, soil, and their proper recycling along with the biodiversity of plant, animal, and microorganisms. Environmental sustainability and sustainable agriculture include the intentional practice of maintaining (engineering or mimicking the nature) healthy soil; managing water wisely; reducing food waste; minimizing pollution of air, water, and soil; promoting biodiversity; reducing tillage; integrating pest management; integrating livestock and crops; adopting sustainable practices, while enhancing the quality of life for communities of agriculture. To date, several sustainable agricultural systems and methods have been developed. In this chapter we revisit several dominant sustainable agriculture systems and methods practiced in agriculture. Each system has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, we need to use more than one system in sustainable agriculture. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding the right balance between the need for food production and the preservation of environmental ecosystems. However, today's majority of conventional agriculture and biotechnology are in directions as in the 20th century and before which focused on only more productions. Production-oriented agriculture already caused significant global climate change, water scarcity, land degradation, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity including agrobiodiversity. Grafting was added to the list of methods that could be used in all systems as a method of sustainable agriculture. We also provided definitions for individual systems and briefly explained the most common methods.

TI  - Local heat, local food: Integrating vertical hydroponic farming with district heating in Sweden
AU  - Gentry, Matthew
T2  - Energy
AB  - By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas. This growth in cities creates a demand for fresh produce to ensure a healthy population, produce that often has to travel a long way to reach the consumer, not only losing quality and nutrition along the way, but also requiring a significant fossil fuel cost for transportation and storage. The average plate of food will travel over 2400 km before it reaches your plate. There is potential within District heating (DH) areas to move farming indoors and into the heart of the urban environment. Vertical hydroponic farming (VHF) offers many advantages over conventional farming including more efficient water and land use, and vastly reduced transport costs if it is performed in the urban area. For this model to become economically sustainable however, it must be intelligently integrated into existing urban infrastructure. A mutually beneficial relationship with DH is possible whereby VHFs are integrated to feed back into the DH system, lower the return temperature in line with 4th Generation District Heating guidelines, and reduce CO2 emissions in food and energy production.

AB  - Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is a popular crop worldwide among farmers; it is relatively easy to grow and is well adapted to hydroponic and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) systems having a high profitability margin. Several studies investigated the effect of the environmental factors on the qualitative and quantitative factors of basil: the effect of light is crucial for development, nutritional properties and sensory characteristics. The principles of sustainability, profitability and resource-effectiveness all encourages farmers to use energy-efficient LED light sources. These tools easily allow for the modification of spectral distribution and light intensity; numerous suggestions have been made for developing goal-driven light recipes for maximum cost-effectiveness and for reducing carbon footprint. Here, the results of several studies are summarized for providing a solid base for light recipe utilization of basil production in terms of light intensity, duration, and spectral distribution. Experimental results related to the impact of light treatments on vegetative parameters, phytonutrient content and sensory properties of basil are discussed, and optimal ranges of light parameters are summarized. Due to the increasing number of promising specialized research the wider application of purpose-driven high-tech production systems is expected in future basil growing.

T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - This study investigates the agro-processing industries potential to develop the local economic in the east of Iran as a developing country based on the sustainable development criteria including economic, social, environmental, and managerial indices. For this purpose, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model based on fuzzy SWARA and fuzzy EDAS technique is developed to determine the global weights of the criteria and prioritize the agro-processing industries as alternatives. Moreover, a conceptual analytical model based on the Porter’s diamond is utilized to evaluate the state of active firms in high-priority agro-processing industries, with the aim of providing the best applicable management insights. According to the findings, the most important sub-criteria are including “income growth by creating value-added”, “payback period”, and “number of jobs created per firm activated”. These sub-criteria are known as one of the most prominent managerial concerns in the local economic development area in Iran as the case study. Focusing on the prioritization results, the agro-processing industries for barberry and saffron products are identified as first-priority industries, while those related to the processing and packaging of medicinal herbs and production of jams and extracts of horticultural crops are ranked as second and third-priority alternatives, respectively. Based on the sensitively analysis, it can be inferred that the final result of selecting the best agro-processing industry is highly robust to the changes in the weight of the most influential sub-criterion. Moreover, Porter model showed that new entrants are not considered as a serious threat. Contrary to the buyers, the suppliers do not have a bargaining power because of the current market condition. Finally, barberry and saffron products have a great competitive rivalry in the national and international markets.

AB  - The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens.

AB  - The growing rate of population and urbanization among African cities versus the reducing arable land has roused curiosity in soilless farming as an urban farming method to enhance food security and urban sustainability. This study investigated the economic viability of producing 60 heads of lettuce using a vertical non-circulating hydroponic system outside the green house as a low cost sustainable urban food production prospect for Africa. This was based on a hydroponic experiment set up in Uganda, East Africa 4 capital budgeting techniques were used for the analysis, that is; Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability index (PI), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Non-discounted Pay Back Period (NDPBP). A sensitivity and scenario analysis were adopted for risk analysis while regression analysis was considered for forecasting and modelling purposes. A discount rate of 10% was considered for the analysis based on the loan borrowing rate. The unit production cost equaled to 0.46$/head and sale price was estimated at 0.75/head. Initial costs deemed necessary for annual production were estimated at 171.1$. Results showed the following economic values: NPV (16.37$), IRR (12.57%), PI (1.1) and NDPBP (4,5) for annual crop production of 6 cycles. NPV was sensitive to changes in discount rate and unit price while revenue varied with a change in quantities sold and unit price as per the scenario analysis. A significant negative and positive linear relationship was found between unit price of lettuce versus quantity sold and revenue earned correspondingly. Adoption of vertical hydroponic lettuce production can be considered an equally cost-effective venture with substantial profits cetris paribus with the potential to increase food security and sustainability around urbanities. Further research needs to be done to assess the profitability of producing other vegetables using the same system across various seasons and cities.

This specifically addresses the problem of traditional workforce reliance on burning peat as a fossil fuel by providing alternative green-friendly eco-innovative activities for new employment and social enterprise. Findings show that this system relies upon a naturally-occurring ecosystem of algae, bacteria and duckweed species to achieve effective waste remediation and for water quality. There is no use of artificial compounds including antibiotics, and no discharge of effluent to receiving waters. Peatlands are a unique ecosystem that constitute an important carbon sink, but also represents a novel environment for climate solutions. This novel peatland-site holds the potential to support the sustainable development goals of the United Nations as described herein.

AB  - Wood pellets are one of biomass-based energy carriers considered important as renewable energy source. This study considers wood pellets for heat and power generation from fast-growing Leucaena and Acacia trees and para-rubber trees in a life cycle perspective. The objectives of this study are to estimate the actual cost (including environmental externalities) of heat and electricity production from wood pellets, and comparison with the external cost of fossil fuels, as well as forecasting the external cost arising from the increase in wood pellet demand. For both heat and electricity production, it was seen that when external costs are included, wood pellets are cheaper than lignite and fuel oil although the latter are cheaper when only internal costs are considered. Four recommendations for reducing the external costs of wood pellet production are: 1) to support sustainable agriculture for para-rubber trees and fast-growing trees, 2) to consider clean transportation in the supply chain, 3) wood pellet factory zoning, including good logistics, and 4) considering the external cost of wood pellets for polluter pays principle. These results and recommendations of the study can provide important information to consider towards adjusting the national energy plan and to have strict measures for avoiding problem shifting from the use of non-renewable resources (fossil fuels) to issues related to the use of biomass-based fuels (use of agro-chemicals, forest encroachment, and so on).

T2  - Journal of Biotechnology
AB  - Human society cannot afford the luxury of the business-as-usual approach when dealing with the emerging challenges of the 21st century. The challenges of food production to meet the pace of population growth in an environmentally-sustainable manner have increased considerably, emphasizing the need to explore newer approaches to agriculture. Agrochemical-based agricultural practices are known to have serious environmental and health implications. Even conventional organic farming is not sustainable in the long run. Although some "age-old" practices are useful, these will not help feed more people on the same or less land more sustainably. Sustainable intensification is the way forward. There is a need to incorporate a customer-centric outlook and make the organic system sustainable. Here, we bring forth the necessity to enhance the efficiency of organic agriculture by the inclusion of robotics and agrochemical-free GM seeds. Such an organic-GM hybrid agriculture system integrated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies will have better energy efficiency. The produce from such a system will offer consumers a ‘third’ choice and create a new food label, ‘organically-grown GM produce’.

AB  - The increasing urbanization of an ever-growing global population is coinciding with major global challenges that are threatening our food security. Urban agriculture is as a multi-functional tool to improve urban living and to provide food security towards resilient communities. This review explores on the importance of urban agriculture and identifies several points that will help inform a shift towards actively managed urban agriculture soils. First, the importance of soil within urban agriculture systems is highlighted, followed by a review of common issues of soil health in urban agriculture. These issues are then addressed by providing management principles for increased soil functioning in urban agriculture systems. These principles focus on improved soil nutrient and carbon pools and acknowledge the importance of the soil microbial community. Soil contamination with metal, organic and microbial contaminants is then addressed through a discussion of options available to help mitigate potential risk factors. Together, this review summarises our current understanding of soil health in urban agriculture systems. Where issues have been identified, these have been addressed by suggesting sustainable management principles. These can be used as recommendations for urban farmers towards more sustainable food production. Finally, we propose educational and governance approaches to help implementing these measurements.

AB  - Worldwide, agriculture and farming systems intrinsically depend on climate but have dramatically changed due to technological progress and expansion, socioeconomic development, shifts in consumption patterns, and the threat of environmental degradation. Almost half of the Earth's farmable land has been converted to croplands, pastures, and rangelands. On the other side, farmers and land managers have affected the agricultural ecosystems through extracting farming and abusive use of resources to increase food production to satisfy either local consumption or trade. Nearly one in three people in the world (2.37 billion) did not have access to adequate food in 2020 an increase of almost 320 million people in just 1year. Consequently, food and nutrition insecurity and climate change emerged as the most pressing and urgent challenges for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the ideals of Agenda 2063. Presently, both developed and developing nations are facing urgent and interconnected challenges that are mining hope for securing food for the growing population and restoring the environment and natural resources. In other terms, less than 10 years into the 2030 Agenda, SDG two is still far from being reached by most countries. A profound understanding of this complexity is fundamental for transitioning to and hence building sustainable food and farming systems. Actions of transformation set the overarching objectives of mobilizing all actors toward zero hunger and net-zero emissions by 2050at the latest. Sustainable agriculture in its various streams, management practices and values, is an essential shift to satisfy the growing population and for tackling these land challenges. Sustainability initiatives are requested to tackle multiple challenges and drivers of agriculture and to provide rollover benefits from both short and long-term solutions to merge toward healthy food systems. From the available experiences and studies, conservation, regenerative, organic, and precision agriculture are the leading processes and game changers being used to help the agriculture sector to reverse the effects of climate change and address other disruptors to the total food supply chain. Such types of agriculture are mainstreaming healthy and durable food systems and revolutionizing farming worldwide. In other terms, these innovative and win-win-win solutions value the health of soils, people, and ecosystems. The SDGs-relating to food, natural resources management, and climate change will or can be attainable if common engagement, globally and locally, of the champions of essential streams of sustainable agriculture, is implemented and enforced in terms of policy, capacity development, technology, institutional settings, and availability of durable funds. Shifting to healthy and plant-based diets and a circular economy could further haste advancement toward regenerative and nutrition-sensitive agriculture and environmental sustainability.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the performance of vegetables using a non-greenhouse hydroponic system as a sustainable urban farming technology to increase food security (in terms of vegetable production and availability). Leafy lettuce (red and green) was grown using non-circulating hydroponics under a complete randomized design. The effect of hydroponics on growth and yield of the vegetables was studied. Six parameters were studied: plant height, length of the root, number of leaves, weight of lettuce, moisture content and dry matter. Data was collected 20 and 40 Days after transplanting and analyzed using T-test at 5% significance level with Origin Pro software (version 9.0). Soil-based cultivation was used as the control experiment. A significant difference (P < 0.05) existed at yield for lettuce grown under soil and hydroponics for; dry matter content (0.02, 0.01), fresh weight (0.03, 0.02) and root length (0.01, 0.02) in that order. Based on number of leaves which is the key edible part of the vegetable, hydroponics has the potential to perform as equally well as conventional farming. Further research can be done to study the nutritional composition of the lettuce and performance of the other vegetables using the system.

AB  - Light conditions are crucial for vegetable quality in terms of sensory properties and nutritional composition. Well planned lighting systems enable effective production and extend production season, even for year around production. Further factors, like climate change, growing urban population (urban plant factories), seasonal employment, developing consumer expectations in security, safety, freshness, and price-quality ratio of vegetables and fruits reinforce the expansion of LED systems. The main obstacle of shifting to LED lighting in plant production is that involves a complex system change beyond lighting (e.g. plant recipes, which are species- and in several cases cultivar-dependent), resulting serious associated costs. Also, lack of quality standards for solid state lighting in horticulture has been frequently mentioned. Therefore, light source measurement, parameters, metrics, and labeling was reviewed. Presented increasing number of scientific publications, patents and the increasing role of LEDs in R + D, and innovation related projects indicate that the technological background is developing fast.

AB  - The urban agriculture is fully developed for several years and we estimated that more than 75% of the world population will live in urban zones before 2050. The food supply and the food safety are threatened and the urban agriculture could help to solve this problem. VERDIR is a global and integrated project carried by the University of Liège to contribute to the social, cultural, environmental, and economic transition in the South part of Belgium (Wallonia). Wallonia cultivates the tradition of steel and iron for centuries and inventories estimate the number of brownfields in approximately 5000, representing a total surface about 10,000 hectares. Eighty percent of these former industrial sites are situated in peri-urban and urban zones. Moreover, the active steel and iron industries reject important quantities of hot waters, hot gases, and carbon dioxide in the environment. These industrial thermal discharges represent more than 20% of the energy consumed in Wallonia. The possibilities of rehabilitating former industrial sites or the valorization of industrial thermal discharges are numerous. But, recently the urban farming and the development of plant factories have become more and more an important renovation model of brownfields offering new jobs and new industrial sectors. The VERDIR project is a new rehabilitation concept of industrial sites, which mixes the practices of urban agriculture and the production of biomass to high added value molecule. VERDIR project is the beginning of a new economic model based on circular economy, short circuits, collective intelligence, coworking, and social innovation.

AB  - Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is used for efficient food production. Efficiency can be increased further by interconnecting different CEA systems (e.g. plants and insect larvae or fish and larvae), using products and by-products of one system in the other. These interconnected systems define an overall system that can be described by models of interacting species. It is necessary to identify system parameters (e.g. initial species concentration, harvest rate, feed quality, etc.) such that the resources are not exhausted. For such systems with interacting species, modelled by the Lotka-Volterra equations, a set-based approach based on the recent results of the theory of barriers to exactly determine the so-called admissible set (also known as viability kernel) and the maximal robust positively invariant set is presented. Using an example of a larvae-fish based production system, steps to obtain special trajectories which are the boundaries of the admissible set are shown. This admissible set is used to prevent the under and over population of the species in the CEA. Furthermore, conditions of the system parameters are stated, such that the existence of these trajectories can be guaranteed.

AB  - Hydroponic fodder production in controlled environment (CE) settings have gained more focus in recent years due to the shortage of agricultural land for food production and the adverse effect of climate changes. However, the operation costs and dry matter issues are the major concerns for the sustainability of fodder production in the CE. This study provides a comprehensive literature review on techniques and control strategies for indoor environments and watering that are currently used and could be adopted in the future to achieve the economic and environmental sustainability of controlled environment fodder production (CEFP). The literature indicates fodder production in the modular system is becoming popular in developed countries, and low-tech systems like greenhouse are more prevalent in developing countries. The optimum temperature and RH range between 16-27°C and 70-80% to get efficient biomass yield; however, minimal research has been conducted to optimize the indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) for efficient and higher efficiency fodder production. Besides, the water-saving techniques and optimal lighting spectrum need to be studied extensively. Automating and monitoring in CEFP system could reduce operating costs and improve quality and yield. Overall, this industry might have great potential for livestock production. Still, more strong research needs to be conducted to answer nutritional concerns and reduce the capital and operating costs for CEFP.

AB  - Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is critically required for sustaining plant and vegetable growth. This study investigated PAR availabilities in two typical large-scale greenhouses using an advanced method of climate-based solar modelling in China. Seven Chinese locations in terms of daylight (solar) climate zones and latitudes were studied. The PAR prediction was conducted via RADIANCE (ray-tracing solar and light simulation package). Key findings were: 1) A climate-based analysis was proved as more practical than the methods based on only clear sky and solar geometries. 2) A ray-tracing solar modelling could effectively predict PAR levels at specific positions (e.g. vertical planes), which could benefit the development of vertical farming activities. 3) The PAR availability could receive insignificant impact from roof configuration in these large-scale greenhouses. 4) For the approach of vertical farming, the vertical arrangement of planting system could be significantly affected by greenhouse orientations, while horizontally no such effect can be found. These findings could be developed into design strategies to support greenhouse planning.

AB  - Lettuce is one of the most important crops of plant factories with artificial lighting (PFALs) due to their small size, fast growth rate, low energy demand and high marketing value. High-end adjustable LED-based lighting environments, as well as controlled environment smart solutions enable producers to fine-tune leafy crop production according to consumer demands. However, knowledge about light quality, quantity and duration related underlying mechanisms influencing the production-biological traits of lettuce is still incomplete. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive picture about the interrelations of light parameters and lettuce vegetative development and phytochemical content based on available experimental results with special emphasis on existing knowledge gaps, the impact of spatial PPFD variation, as well as variations in R/B and R/FR ratios. Besides light duration, the effect of pulsed lighting, interlighting and upward lighting is also discussed. Smart PFAL systems are knowledge-demanding in terms of automated light recipes, growth predictors, machine vision and automated controlling systems. The future development directions and perspectives visible from international studies are also summarized for supporting PFAL growers in future investments and to inspire researchers to conduct studies in this field. Among light parameters, the effect of PPFD, light duration, and spectral compositions and ratios was in the focus of most studies in the last decade; less attention is paid for the analysis of the impact of light pulsation and of light parameters uniformity so far. The development of sensing technology enables a cutting-edge shift from 2D light characterization to 3D sensing, which is optimized to the multi-layer system of plants.

AB  - A potential change in climate and temperature could strongly affect weather-related crop losses. Using wastelands to grow crops in controlled greenhouse environments could improve global food security and preserve ecosystems. However, the impact of climate change on additional energy and water requirements of greenhouse-horticulture food production is still unknown. Using a greenhouse simulator for four locations (The Netherlands, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Namibia), we show that a rise in outdoor temperatures can be counterbalanced with a more intensive water-based cooling. Between 6.9% and 17.9%, more water is required in the worst-case scenario in the year 2100, while the yield quantity decreases by 3%–6% due to slightly deteriorating growth conditions within the greenhouse. Since cooling systems consume up to 90% of the total water use in desert greenhouses, saltwater cooling could play an essential role in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of greenhouse horticulture systems in arid regions. In this study, we investigate the economic and technical feasibility of such greenhouse systems on a larger scale and show the massive potential of these systems. The developed scenarios demonstrate considerable climate resilience, enabling the cultivation of fresh vegetables in arid and infertile regions both presently and in the future.

AU  - Mok, Wai Kit

T2  - Trends in Food Science & Technology
AB  - Background
Food security is becoming an increasingly important global issue. Anthropogenic factors such as rapid urbanization and industrialization have strained finite resources like land and water. Therefore, against the impending threat of food security, the world can no longer rely on traditional methods to meet its needs. Instead, more creative and technologically advanced methods must be adopted to maximise diminishing natural resources. Singapore is a good case study of a small city-state that is trying to increase its own self-production of food using technology.
Scope and approach
This review highlights the technologies that Singapore have adopted in enhancing food security given its limitation in natural resources. These methodologies serve as a case study that can be used as a reference point in light of the increasingly finite natural resources. The review also presents the advantages of these techniques as well as challenges that need to be overcome for them to be more widely adopted.
Key findings and conclusion
To increase self-production of food and enhance its food security, Singapore has employed the use of technologies such as vertical farming and aquaponics in urban farming, nutrient recovery from food waste, biodegradable food packaging from durian rinds, natural preservatives, insect farming, microalgae and cultivated meat as alternative protein sources. These technologies workaround Singapore's land and natural resource constraints, which many countries around the world can adapt. However, many of them are still relatively nascent with numerous challenges, which have to be addressed before they can be widely accepted and implemented.

AB  - Agroecosystems are the largest human-natural coupled production system covering ~40% of the planet earth and provide essential ecosystem services for a good quality of life and human wellbeing. The sustainable management of agroecosystems are therefore essential for meeting the food, fuel, fiber, and fodder demands of the rapidly growing human population. Agroecosystems also play a key role in trace gases emission, and also affect the quality and usage of life-supporting resources such as air, water, soil etc. Though the sustainable management of agroecosystems are imperative for achieving UN-Sustainable Development Goals, they are frequently under degradation due to multiple drivers of changes such as unsustainable land-use practices, biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change, etc. Therefore, cordial efforts at national, regional and global levels are essential for managing agroecosystems to meet out the global goals and also the targets of the United Nations- Decade o-n Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030). Here we opined various strategies for restoring degraded agroecosystems for sustainable development including the adoption of emerging paradigms such as micro-agriculture, urban agriculture, and landless agriculture for averting the mounting pressure on agroecosystems for the benefit of both people and the planet.

T2  - One Earth
AB  - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, urban air pollution, and contamination of oceans by plastic waste have dramatically increased awareness that human civilization faces an existential environmental crisis. Here, we argue that the way humankind views its place on planet Earth is the cause of this crisis and of the reluctance to take meaningful and urgent action. This view gives humans the right to exploit everything on Earth for their own benefit and a belief that sustainability can be delivered through exploiting nature in a smarter way and controlling it better. We propose that humankind rejects this view and instead learns to live in harmony with life on Earth by respecting the land, the oceans, and the atmosphere from which everything derives. We show how knowledge, creativity, and innovation can drive transformation in all sectors of society to enable this new relationship to develop, re-defining sustainability in terms of all life on Earth.

AB  - Productive façades (PFs) that integrate photovoltaic (PV) panels and vertical farming (VF) planters are designed to act as sustainable, multi-functional, modular building envelope systems. Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world and its high-rise buildings play a critical role in the urban context offering a significantly larger surface area of walls than roofs. PFs represent an appropriate, novel technological response to a number of issues Singapore is facing such as a high dependence on imported energy and food, scarcity of land, planned reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the increase of high-rise greenery coverage. The potential of PFs in harvesting solar energy, which is currently the most viable renewable energy source (RES), and in utilizing the characteristics of the urban context, is promising. The study analyses the acceptance of the developed PF concept by its potential future users—residents of high-rise public housing blocks. A door-to-door survey was conducted among the residents of the Housing & Development Board (HDB) buildings (consisting of apartments or flats) with two main purposes: examining whether the residents accept or are positively inclined towards the PF concept and its implementation and secondly, identifying their preferences related to aesthetical qualities, use and maintenance of PF designs. The results indicate a highly affirmative response among a very high percentage of respondents towards gardening. They also indicate that PF concepts promoting small-scale VF adequately fit the needs of HDB residents. The preferences of the potential future users regarding PF types are further presented and discussed. The insights obtained will help further the knowledge on PFs and directly assist planners, architects, contractors and decision makers (DMs) as guidelines in the design of PFs in the tropics, enabling such systems to meet the needs, expectations and preferences of users and to address their concerns.

AB  - The debate on the role of urban agriculture in the sustainable city discourse remains unresolved in the conventional literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review relevant literature to clarify the role of urban agriculture in sustainable cities. The search for literature was guided by themes such as: a) urban agricultural practices, b) indicators for the measurement of sustainable cities, c) economic, social and environmental benefits of urban agriculture, and d) negative effects of urban agriculture on the city. The results from a synthesis of the literature indicate that urban agriculture supports the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cities. However, if the discussion gives credence to only the economic dimension of sustainability, then urban agriculture loses the debate. This is because the economic benefits of prime city land that is used used for non-agricultural purposes (such as commercial or industrial) is profound. However, the social and environmental functions of responsible urban agriculture, particularly in reducing the rift between urbanisation and nature, may be difficult to quantify. These social and environmental functions underscore the importance of urban agriculture in the city landscape. The paper concludes by arguing that focussing on only economic sustainability in the urban agriculture-sustainable city discourse is a travesty of the idea of sustainable development. The paper presents practical steps that can be taken to preserve agriculture in cities towards their sustainability.

AB  - Plant factories have developed within urban contexts following efforts to expand local food production, create local jobs, and provide alternatives to conventional agriculture with lower greenhouse gas emissions. One plant factory system, container farms, consists of artificially lit, vertically stacked hydroponic farms inside retrofitted shipping containers and support crop production in otherwise unused locations regardless of climate and daylight availability. Given their high energy intensity, municipalities considering container farms require reliable models to study their overall environmental performance and feasibility. While previous studies have used co-simulators to consider plant-air interactions within building performance simulation (BPS) tools, energy validation studies are lacking for such models. This research presents the validation of an EnergyPlus model of a hydroponic container farm in Boston, Massachusetts based on nine months of measured data. Despite shortcomings in predicting of hourly conditioning energy, the resulting calibrated energy model achieves a Normalized Mean Bias Error of 3% and a Coefficient of Variation of the Root-Mean-Square Error of 11%. Results show that through representing plant-air interactions within EnergyPlus and modeling cooling coefficient of performance as a function of outdoor air temperature, stakeholders can reliably predict annual container farm energy use.

AB  - Urban agriculture has become increasingly popular as a viable solution to the global food insecurity, but the uncontrollable expansion of cities and populations has led to the significant decrease in cultivable space for conventional soil-based farming. Unlike conventional agriculture, soil-less hydroponic farming allows sustainable food production in urban areas without compromising the environment and public health. Using both theory of planned behaviour and knowledge-attitude-behaviour theory with four additional factors, the current study examined the intention and adoption of hydroponic farming among Chinese urbanites. An online survey, which involved 661 respondents from different cities in China, was conducted. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling revealed the significant influence of tolerance of diversity, innovativeness, and knowledge about hydroponic system on attitude towards hydroponic system. Additionally, knowledge and attitude towards hydroponic system, perceived need for hydroponic farming, and hydroponic farming compatibility were found to significantly influence the intention of adopting hydroponic farming, which was also found to exhibit significant influence on its actual adoption. This study presented valuable insights that contribute to the development of a framework that promotes effective farming practices and strategies. The obtained findings can benefit marketers, practitioners, and policymakers in the agricultural and environmental fields, particularly in their efforts of planning, designing, marketing, and strategizing to promote modern agricultural practices and create a favourable environment for urban hydroponic farming in developing countries.

AB  - The global food system must meet the increasing demand for food, fiber, and energy while reducing environmental impacts. The UN Food System Summit (UNFSS) has made a clear call to action for a global food systems transformation. We argue that three major discrepancies remain, potentially delaying the urgent implementation of the call to action. First, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are not sufficiently focused on agriculture, leading to funding allocation issues. Second, a mismatch of agroecology with technology innovations may slow scaling agroecological farming. Lastly, agricultural diversification must move beyond organic landscapes and into conventional agriculture. As a solution, principles of NbS should be clear on agricultural integration. Moreover, stakeholder awareness must increase that agroecology does not necessarily conflict with agricultural technologies. Future agricultural models must apply measures such as agricultural diversification in conjunction with technology innovations to then ascertain an overall timely and successful implementation of the UNFSS call to action.

AB  - With rising urban sprawl, the rural villages are getting transformed into urban villages and land constraints are increasing in cities, so it is difficult to designate land for farming. In this case for ensuring food security, innovative technologies like vertical indoor farming through vermiponics and aquaponics can be an alternative option for urban farming. The present study highlights the evaluation of growth and biochemical characteristics of a green vegetable, Amaranthus viridis L. in different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) of cattle dung derived vermiwash (vermiponics) and aquarium water (aquaponics) with tap water as a control. The growth indices such as shoot length, root weight, shoot weight, number of primary and secondary roots, the total number of leaves, leaf area, and wet weight of A. viridis were significantly higher in 100% vermiponics (P<0.05). A maximum of 1.96 mg/g protein and 0.98 mg/g carbohydrates was recorded in 100% vermiwash treatment. Vermiwash showed significantly higher nutrients than aquarium water, which probably influenced the growth and biochemical indices of A. viridis. Conclusively, the integration of vermitechnology with hydroponics technology in vertical indoor farming can be a suitable and sustainable alternative for the futuristic urban farming methods.

T2  - Trends in Food Science & Technology
AB  - Background
Humanity's current use of resources is not in line with the goal of sustainable development. Climate change impact scenarios appear worryingly pessimistic. The agricultural and food production accounts for a particularly high share of the impact, and this also holds for consumption of food. Transforming food consumption plays a crucial role in tackling the challenges, and sensory consumer science can contribute to this.
Scope and approach
This commentary examines what is required of the agricultural and food sector in order to sustainably transform, and outlines the current research streams in sensory consumer science from a sustainability perspective. Based on a comparison of the requirements and research, we suggest a categorization of the contributions that sensory consumer science can make to sustainable development.
Key findings and conclusions
Six necessary transformations to which sensory consumer science can make a contribution are derived and outlined: 1) promotion of a dietary shift towards more sustainable foods and diets, 2) increase of food diversity, 3) food waste reduction, 4) enhancement of the circularity of the food system, 5) heightening and prioritising food-related well-being, and 6) coping with the effects of climate change. So far, sensory consumer science studies have focused on foods regarded as sustainable (e.g. organic, sustainably claimed, insects and meat alternatives) as well as issues that contribute to sustainability (e.g. shelf-life, fruit and vegetable consumption, unfamiliar food). The conclusion for further future research is that designing sensory consumer science research to explicitly target the six required transformations can increase the discipline's contribution to sustainable development.

AB  - Hydroponics is a soilless farming method that can contribute to meeting the global food demand, improving food sustainability as well as ensuring food availability in a novel high efficiency yet low maintenance way. In this global meta-analysis, the crop yields of hydroponic cultivation were quantified and the differences in yields for distinct farming systems as in hydroponic vs. soil-based systems, farming orientations as in vertical vs. horizontal farming and environments as in controlled environment vs. open-air agriculture, were discussed. 499 observations were extracted from 68 papers that discussed hydroponic crop yields. The most studied vegetable crops were “Lettuce and chicory”. The greatest difference in crop productivity between hydroponics and soil-based agriculture was observed in "Spinach," with yields of 2.7 kg m−2 year−1 for hydroponics compared to 16.35 kg m−2 year−1 for soil-based agriculture. The result showed that the productivity of the growing systems varied between crop categories. The impact of the growing orientation was significant for "Lettuce & chicory" and "Vegetables, fresh nes", but there was no clear pattern indicating the best growing orientation overall. The crop yields of the controlled environment were significantly higher than the open-air setup; it had a significant effect on “Anise, badian, fennel, coriander”, “Cabbage & other brassicas”, “Lettuce & chicory” and “Vegetables, fresh nes”. This meta-analysis helps in quantifying the globally relevant crop yields of hydroponic farming systems, seeks to provide more solid evidence of the crop yields for hydroponic agriculture and determines the better hydroponic growing environment.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges humanity faces is feeding the world’s human population in a sustainable, nutritious, equitable and ethical way under a changing climate. Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create tradeoffs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind. Overall, strong good governance is needed at multiple levels, combining top-down and bottom-up processes.

AB  - The provision of food is fundamental for society, but it is also a major driver of environmental change. Cities are important consumers of food, harboring more than half of the global population, a share that is expected to grow in the coming decades. Here we investigate the urban food system of Vienna, a large central European city. We quantify the land and greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of Vienna's food system and explore potentials to reduce the urban footprint through changes in food consumption, applying a counterfactual approach. We systematically compare the land and GHG effect of a shift of consumption towards i) diets with a lower share of animal products, ii) food from regional agriculture and iii) food from organic agriculture, based on the FoodClim model presented in this study. Our results show that Vienna's food system currently requires 639000 ha of agricultural land, about two thirds of it in foreign countries and emits 2.29 Mt CO2e/yr over the whole supply chain. A change in diets has the largest impact, reducing both Vienna's food system land footprint by 54% and its GHG footprint by 57%, while the effect of regionalization is comparatively small. Combined scenarios show that it is possible to maintain a healthy level of meat in diets and to switch to organic agriculture with lower land and livestock productivities and to still save half of the GHG emissions, while avoiding an expansion of the land footprint.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - Providing healthy food for the world’s growing urban population is a recognized global challenge and it is likely that current modes of conventional, large-scale farming will over time be increasingly complemented by local, urban farming practices. Apart from its acknowledged social benefits, urban farming is also widely viewed as a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional remote farming. Especially indoor, soilless cultivation in urban areas is being portrayed as a particularly sustainable solution. However, as this technique relies on controlled environments, its ongoing operation can be quite energy-intensive and related carbon emissions should be carefully weighed against reduced emissions, such as those from transportation. To further this goal, this article presents a simulation-based environmental analysis workflow for Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) in urban contexts, that includes detailed solar radiation, water and energy specific models. The aim of the workflow is to guide the user through decision-making on the potentialities of implementing BIA in a given neighborhood while maximizing crop yields and minimizing water and energy consumption. The workflow was applied to three hi-tech urban farming scenarios in Lisbon, Portugal: a polycarbonate Rooftop Greenhouse (RG), a Vertical Farm (VF) with windows and skylights on the top floor of a reinforced-concrete building as well as a completely opaque VF with no penetration of natural light on the ground floor of a reinforced-concrete building. Global Warming Potential (GWP) related to water, transportation and operational energy of these three case studies were compared to GWP of (i) the currently existing supply chain for tomato, and (ii) a hypothetical low-tech unconditioned rooftop urban farm. Results show that the RG and the top floor VF had the best overall environmental performance, respectively cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half and in three in comparison with the existing supply chain for tomato. By allowing this preliminary assessment of alternative farm locations and properties, the workflow provides the user with actionable information for early-stage holistic assessment of BIA projects.

AB  - Agriculture, through its economic, social and ecological functions, presents potentials for meeting some of the targets of the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The targets include: a) reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities (target 11.6), b) providing access to green spaces (target 11.7) and c) promoting resource-use efficiency in cities (target 11b). Nevertheless, cities, especially those in the global south, are struggling to sustain agriculture due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation. How to maintain (peri-) urban agriculture in cities and their peripheries in an era of increasing land scarcity is unclear in the conventional literature. In this regard, this study set out to determine appropriate practices globally that can foster the sustenance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and determine their applicability to the Ghanaian context. Even though Ghana remains the focus of the discussion, the generality of the characteristics of the cities in Sub-Saharan Africa makes the practices useful to Sub-Saharan African region. The study obtained the required data, through a review of literature, from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, MeSH and ProQuest. The authors complemented the literature from these conventional sources with literature from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results of the literature review show that container gardening, backyard gardening, and farming on vacant lands and marginal lands can hold the key to preserving agriculture within the cities. However, these models are more appropriate for the production of vegetables and herbs. Therefore, urban and peri-urban agriculture may concentrate on the production of herbs and vegetables, to complement the food supply from rural agriculture. The Purchase of Development Right and expropriation and zoning of peri-urban land for agricultural purposes appear to be important strategies for promoting access to land for peri-urban agriculture. The strategies call for revisions of city legislation and the land use planning process to legitimise and promote agriculture in cities and their peripheries.

AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that more than 800 million people engage in urban agriculture producing more than 15% of the world's food. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in urban agriculture in many wealthy, developed cities, with new technology and agro-architecture being employed to grow food in cities at commercial scale. This has been accompanied by an increase in media coverage. Big claims are being made, including that urban agriculture can decrease greenhouse emissions, ‘climate proof’ farms, help solve food security for growing urban populations and provide chemical free food with no risk of pests and diseases. Many of these claims need to be rigorously tested to ensure that sound investments can be made in enterprises that are financially viable and capable of delivering on claims of social and environmental benefits. Around the world, traditional broadacre and horticulture farming have been underpinned by years of biological, chemical, physical, economic and social research. Urban agriculture needs similar support as the industry grows and develops around the world. There are opportunities to improve crop yields and quality by pairing advancements in environmental controls, phenomics and automation with breeding efforts to adapt traits for architecture, development and quality (taste and nutrition) allowing a more diverse set of crops to be grown in controlled-environment farms. Urban farms are uniquely placed to take advantage of urban waste energy, water and nutrients but innovations are needed to use these resources safely and economically. This review discusses the technological research and innovations necessary for urban agriculture to meet the nutritional requirements of growing urban populations.

AB  - Major common production activities on organic soils require drainage, which results in the loss of important ecosystem services such as carbon storage. This paper provides an overview of the farming situation on organic soils in a western region of Switzerland characterized by intensive vegetable farming and therefore by high opportunity costs of adopting sustainable practices on these soils. Based on a review of the academic and grey literature and interviews with regional experts, we find that the main challenges to a change in management practices include the profitability of the current land use, the difficult economic environment of farmers, the cultural background associated with the region, and the absence of systematic data on soil properties. We provide a comparative overview of policy options that could promote sustainable use of organic soils, and present the diverse economic, environmental, and social implications of potential future scenarios of the development on these soils, namely pursuing the current land use versus adopting peat-preserving land use. Based on a basic economic analysis, we find that considering the carbon benefits of preserving the soils, current offsetting-carbon policies cannot compensate the opportunity cost of switching land use on organic soils used for intensive vegetable farming. With the price of carbon offsetting options, only up to the half of the opportunity cost would be covered. We therefore stress the need for a long-term vision of the management decision on these soils and for eliciting society’s willingness to invest in preserving organic soils.

AB  - Food security and nutrition security raise multiple questions at both the local and global levels. Experts have formulated three major challenges for the 21st century in this regard: the depletion of natural materials, the loss of environmental quality, and the assurance or guarantee of food supplies. Will we be able to produce enough food for an expanding global population? Will everyone have access to sufficient food? Will increasing food production not have to be paid for by deforestation and reduced biodiversity? Will increasing food production have an excessive impact on the environment? What kind of impact will climate change have on the production of food? What kind of potential do alternative production methods have? Should regions endeavor to establish independence with respect to their food needs? This chapter provides an overview of key elements of Food and Nutrition Security and points out key enablers for transition toward sustainable food systems.

AB  - Globally, soil quality is decreasing, putting additional pressure on our food system. As soil degradation continues and freshwater supplies become scarce, development of farming approaches that use both land and water more efficiently and productively to grow food is essential. This need has created a niche for scientists and farmers to develop techniques to improve either land productivity or to use alternative agricultural techniques. Twenty four percent of the UK farmers now employ some form of precision farming, whereby a range of sensors, drones, or satellite imagery is used in order to generate data about the growing crop’s specific needs and requirements in terms of water, fertilization, or other inputs. Precision farming can be employed through a range of different techniques which will be discussed further in this chapter.

AB  - The yield gaps between conventional and progressive farms have widened considerably, globally. Precision farming, the use of site-specific agricultural inputs accurately through decision support mechanisms, has the ability to lower the potential crop yield gap. This chapter offers an outline on the development of precision agriculture technologies (PATs) and its current adoptability status based on published literature from the past twodecades. The focus of this chapter is mainly on the transformation of agriculture from mechanized to precision agriculture (PA). The role of PA, variability management zones, resources variability, sensors innovation in agricultural engineering, and the development of precision agricultural machinery to maximize the farm output will be discussed. Moreover, recent development of remote sensing and GIS applications in agriculture, use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for agriculture, global application of PA, adoption tendency of PAT, and potential for adopting the precision agricultural technologies in developing countries (i.e., Pakistani farm settings) to modernize the conventional farming and maximize the farm yield are also discussed. There have been a number of advanced countries that already have adopted the PAT, including the United States and Europe, in the 1980s and 1990s. However, in developing countries, farmers are still conservative to use these technologies either due to high technology cost or otherwise, less adoptability to new technologies. In this chapter, we have examined the problems and recommend possible solutions to the developing countries for worldwide adoptability of PATs. The researchers and farmers can follow the recommended suggestions for the adoptability of PATs to maximize the farm income, which will ensure the global food security.

AB  - Lab meats, solar foods, indoor farming, and microalgae are promoted as means to reduce carbon, land and water footprint and to free land for rewilding, production of biofuels, or others. Many of those are energy intensive and if the water and land use for energy production are considered, the claims of efficiency are questionable. Apart from doubtful claims, the narrative of food tech and farm-free foods is one of a further, illusory decoupling of human civilization from the natural world. But freeing us from soil and toil also means freeing us from meaning and connectedness with the other living beings. By reconnecting to the land and relocalizing our economy, we can also achieve more meaningful lives.

AB  - A debate has emerged over the potential socio-ecological drivers of wildlife-origin zoonotic disease outbreaks and emerging infectious disease (EID) events. This Review explores the extent to which the incidence of wildlife-origin infectious disease outbreaks, which are likely to include devastating pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, may be linked to excessive and increasing rates of tropical deforestation for agricultural food production and wild meat hunting and trade, which are further related to contemporary ecological crises such as global warming and mass species extinction. Here we explore a set of precautionary responses to wildlife-origin zoonosis threat, including: a) limiting human encroachment into tropical wildlands by promoting a global transition to diets low in livestock source foods; b) containing tropical wild meat hunting and trade by curbing urban wild meat demand, while securing access for indigenous people and local communities in remote subsistence areas; and c) improving biosecurity and other strategies to break zoonosis transmission pathways at the wildlife-human interface and along animal source food supply chains.

AB  - Majority of under-developed countries continue to face a challenge of food insecurity around urban areas resulting from factors such as; limited access to arable land. This study aimed at developing a simplified low-tech hydroponic system for growing leafy vegetables alongside testing its economic viability. This was intended to support urban vegetable production and henceforth contributing to food security more so in under-developed states dealing with the challenge of increasing urban population vs. reducing arable land around urban/ peri-urban areas. A hydroponic unit for growing 60 leafy vegetables (using lettuce as a study crop) under non-controlled environmental conditions was designed and developed using low-cost and low-tech materials. Kratky hydroponic method which involves growing crops using water as a media without the need for water pumps and electricity was used. A study was also carried out to assess the profitability of the system. The results indicated a: net present values of 16.37$, internal rate of return of 12.57%, profitability index of 1.1 and non-discounted payback period of approximately 8 months (4 cropping seasons). These findings showed that the system has the potential to improve urban food production and availability in especially in developing countries in a profitable manner. Vegetable production using the hydroponic system can also contribute to:•tachievement of sustainable development goals, 2 (zero hunger) and 3 (good health and wellbeing);•improvement in urban agriculture production and income generation among urban farmers;•enhanced adoption of low-cost, low-tech, environmental-friendly and sustainable farming systems.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion for biogas production is known as an effective way of organic waste management. However, in countries rich in fossil fuels resources, its application is very limited. The present research aimed to find whether farm biogas plant could be economic in Iran, where low price natural gas and electricity are available in the most of the regions. Capital cost, net income, internal rate of return, and return of investment of a farm biogas plant was calculated assuming three different scenarios for a 400 head dairy farm; 1) Combined heat and power biogas plant by treatment of 4,562 t y−1 manure: power injection to the grid, and heat to be used in farm or be sold to the potential nearby clients, 2) biogas plant only for power generation by treatment of 4,562 t y−1 manure: power injection to the grid, and 3) No power generation: Treatment of 1,200 t.y-1 for substitution of current heating and cooking fuel (liquefied petroleum gas and diesel) by biogas. The technical and economic calculations were based on biomethane potential test (BMP). The economic analysis results showed that the return of investment in all scenarios was less than 4 years. The surplus net income of the farm from digester including energy and bio-fertilizer production from the three scenarios were 32,000, 38,000, and 6,400 US$ per year. Overall, all three scenarios are economically feasible in Iran, if the biogas plant is constructed domestically.

AU  - Knorr, D.

T2  - Trends in Food Science & Technology
AB  - Background
The concepts of sustainability and food systems have developed over time and their definitions vary depending on different discipline perspectives. There has been an evolution of the term sustainability, particularly as it relates to the sustainability of food systems. However, most discussions around food systems sustainability focus on food production and nutrition, and omit considerations of major parts of the food value chain, notably food processing and preparation.
Scope and approach
In this review, the transitions required to move from linear food chains to closed loop systems to the wider food web for more sustainable food systems are discussed. The interdependencies between resource use, the activities in the food chain and various sustainability indicators are considered. A model for stimulating discussion about the complexity of value chains in the food web is presented.
Key findings and conclusions
There is an urgent need for radical change in the food system to ensure the long term sustainability of the planet. Clear, understandable and globally accepted definitions and indicators for sustainability need to be developed. The increasing complexities in food value chains have to be considered when developing solutions for enhancing food systems sustainability. Food processing and preparation have crucial roles in transforming existing food systems to make them more sustainable. A systems-based approach to developing sustainable food systems, that includes improving natural resource use, reducing environmental impact, examining new food resources, enhancing consumer trust and understanding, and developing profitable market opportunity-led solutions for food and nutrition security, is required.

AB  - The combination of ongoing trends such as increased productivity, demand for capital-intensive technology, and urbanization will in all probability reshape the dimension of a number of business models in agriculture. The purpose of this chapter is to identify possible agribusiness models for developed and developing countries, particularly for the European context and sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia-Pacific area. To parse out these constructs, several socioeconomic and technological factors, key facts, and figures about worldwide agriculture have been gathered and analyzed, taking into account global and local patterns affecting changes in farm structure and food chains. We have hence identified seven possible innovative agricultural business models to be applied in Europe and in low-income countries, with innovation driving products, processes, and technologies: while in Europe business models are more focused on defining farm structures and consumers' eating habits, in developing countries they concentrate on ensuring stable food chains for the immediate future. This review contributes to the scientific debate by providing evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of different business models, helping to understand how the agricultural development process unfolds in relation to business and technology in the decades to come. Moreover, it helps actors of food value chains to understand drivers and trends of the agriculture of the future, enabling farmers and technology providers to converge their interests.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a design framework for retrofitting a light industrial building with a hybrid renewable energy-assisted hydroponics farming system for production of fresh food in rural north Canadian communities. This design protocol is targeted at facilities in rural areas of northern Canada, which could benefit from better access to fresh food, especially given the harsh climate as well as the long and limited transport routes. The process includes 1) a review of the existing building; 2) estimation of design loads for system sizing, such as temperature and humidity control, adequate lighting, airborne carbon, and water; 3) multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization of the hybrid renewable energy system for minimal operating cost and emissions; and 4) comparison of costs and greenhouse (GHG) emissions of the proposed farming operation with the traditional food supply chain. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a case study building in a rural community in Alberta, Canada was evaluated for retrofit. The results showed that the GHG emissions generated from local hydroponic lettuce production, aided by a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), are three times greater than those emitted by transporting an equivalent quantity of food from southern California, USA. On the other hand, the life cycle cost showed that the cost to produce lettuce from the case study facility is comparable to the price of lettuce available from traditional import, which shows a promising potential to provide fresh and cost-competitive food in the community, among other qualitative benefits gained from this empowering opportunity.

AB  - Saffron is traditionally a family farming crop, grown on relatively small-scale farms based on the sustainability of yield with reliance on locally available resources. Due to its expansion in areas of the cultivation worldwide, innovations are needed in production and processing. There are several factors that limit saffron production and yield at a worldwide scale including lack of access to high-quality plant materials, mismanagement of agricultural inputs, and the loss of technical knowledge and new technologies. This chapter addresses new techniques in saffron production such as soilless beds, forced flowering, applications of hormones, organic production, and smart farming using multidisciplinary large data sets to manage farms. We also consider new uses of saffron in animal feeding and saffron waste for packaging alongside e-commerce as new ways to trade this spice.

AB  - East Africa has the potential to boost its urban food production through adoption of soilless farming techniques. The case study assessed the benefits and drawbacks allied with hydroponic vegetable farming among urban and peri‑urban farms in Northern Tanzania and Central Uganda. Snowball sampling was used to identify 150 vegetable farms/farmers through urban farmers’ groups and recommendations from the agricultural organizations from Uganda and Tanzania. Based on the complexity and distinctiveness of this farming system, only 51 individuals engaging in hydroponic vegetable production took part in responding to the semi-structured Google form questionnaire that was issued through social media platforms, face to face interviews and farm visits. Results from the study showed that hydroponics is a climate smart farming system (n = 13, 26%), produces high yields within limited space (n = 24, 48%), has no soil borne pests and diseases (n = 10, 20%) and gives the farmer the ability to control environmental conditions (n = 2, 4%). On the contrary, over 50% of the respondents reported high investment costs (n = 16, 31%) and lack of adequate knowledge on hydroponics (n = 11, 22%) as the main limitations of the technology. Based on farmers’ recommendations, hydroponics has potential to increase food security within urban areas if more efforts are put in sensitization about the farming system and research into ways to reduce the high costs associated with the technology.

AB  - Integration of urban agriculture in cities is shaped by available productive spaces, urban morphologies, socio-economic conditions, initiatives of the government and private organizations, and people’s motivations, perceptions, and awareness. The suitability of integrating various urban agriculture typologies such as home, community, rooftop, balcony, and container gardens varies with different densities of urban forms. This chapter will review the urban design and planning approaches and models of food urbanism and analyze the potential of weaving these local productive spaces at low, medium, and high residential density developments using practical case studies. This analysis will comprehend how local food production could guide urban transformation when it is central to designing and planning for built environments and could enable the development of more resilient and liveable urban forms.

AB  - Vienna’s biomass demand is large and nearly all biomass consumed in the city is produced in the regional and global hinterland. This raises the question, how the socioecological conditions at specific places somewhere in the world are impacted by urban consumption and how negative impacts can be addressed and mitigated by urban actors. Here we focus on the city’s biodiversity footprint and argue that the spatial mismatch between the social-ecological impacts of biomass production and consumption and its impact on biodiversity on the one hand, and the governance instruments available at a city level mentioned by the interviewed experts on the other hand, must be considered when looking for bottom-up governance strategies of urban actors. We combine food regime theory, the analysis of biomass flows and a multiscalar governance approach to analyze “biomass from somewhere” in three important sectors of biomass use in Vienna – food, energy and construction timber. We find that consumption in Vienna requires 3.1 Mio. t of primary biomass per year (2010–2013), of which 59 % are for food, 28 % for material (only 1.3 % for construction) and 13 % for energy; roughly half of this biomass was sourced from Austria, the rest from other countries, mainly in Europe. While governance instruments at the city level are quite effective with respect to urban ecosystems and conservation within the city, they are insufficient to tackle biodiversity loss in the global hinterland. Important leverage points at the city scale are public procurement and the promotion of consumption patterns with lower land and primary biomass demand. An important prerequisite is unambiguous information and labelling concerning the biodiversity impacts of biomass products which is complicated by the fact that indirect land use effects need to be considered. Currently, none of the governance measures investigated includes extensive biodiversity criteria. We conclude that to effectively address the spatial mismatch, a different mode of production – regulated at higher scales and including mandatory measures – and a different mode of consumption as well as a reduction of consumption and production is required.

AB  - Societies must transform their dynamics to support the flourishing of life. There is increasing interest in regeneration and regenerative practice as a solution, but also limited cohered understanding of what constitutes regenerative systems at social-ecological scales. In this perspective we present a conceptual, cross-disciplinary, and action-oriented regenerative systems framework, the Regenerative Lens, informed by a wide literature review. The framework emphasizes that regenerative systems maintain positive reinforcing cycles of wellbeing within and beyond themselves, especially between humans and wider nature, such that “life begets life.” We identify five key qualities needed in systems to encourage such dynamics: an ecological worldview embodied in human action; mutualism; high diversity; agency for humans and non-humans to act regeneratively; and continuous reflexivity. We apply the Lens to an envisioned future food system to illustrate its utility as a reflexive tool and for stretching ambition. We hope that the conceptual clarity provided here will aid the necessary acceleration of learning and action toward regenerative systems.

AB  - A growing human population and changing consumption patterns threaten adequate food supply globally by increasing pressure on already scarce land and water resources. Various measures have been suggested to sustainably secure future food supply: diet change, food loss reduction and closing the yield gap of nutrients as well as water. As yet, they have been assessed separately or, if combined, at a global or macro-region level only. In this paper, we carry out a review and integration of this literature to provide a first estimate of the combined potential of these measures at country level. The overall potential increase in global food supply was estimated to be 111% and 223% at moderate and high implementation levels, respectively. Projected global food demand in 2050 could thus be met, but deficiencies in various countries in Africa and the Middle East appear inevitable without changes to trade or adapting with future innovations. Further, this analysis highlights country-level management opportunities for each intervention studied. Several potential future research opportunities are proposed to improve integration of measures.

AB  - Currently, agriculture-based food production is significantly less when compared to the population growth. Therefore, the practice of the modern-day agricultural production system is much required to enhance and fulfill future food demands. Technologies such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and precision/smart agricultural technologies are key areas that can improve global agricultural productivity. This chapter describes these technologies and their use in the enhancement of agricultural productivity in order to increase food production required to feed the increasing global population.

AB  - China introduced the "agricultural water conversion policy" in 2012 to efficiently utilize agricultural water resources and improve production technology in different regions of the Country to increase sustainable agriculture production. To this end, for Policy impact evaluation, our study employed slack-based measure data envelopment analysis, Meta frontier Analysis, and the Malmquist productivity index to measure the agriculture water usage efficiency, agriculture Production technology heterogeneity, and total factor productivity change in pre- and post-agriculture water policy (2012) implementation in different regions of China. Data for 31 provinces and cities were taken for efficiency and productivity estimation from 2000 to 2020. Results revealed that agriculture water usage efficiency significantly increased after the policy implementation. The average agricultural water usage efficiency score for the 2000–2012pre–policy period is 0.6763, whereas the average AWUE score for the 2013–2020 post–policy period is 0.7522, showing an increase of 11.22%. Further results show that the eastern region maintains superior agriculture production technology compared to the western and central regions, with an average technology gap ratio of 0.8941 during the study period. The average total factor productivity change for the study period is 1.0769. Technological change is the primary determinant of productivity growth. There was a marginal decline in average Productivity change after policy implementation. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test strengthens the study's results by providing statistically significant differences among different periods and regions.

TI  - Risks in urban rooftop agriculture: Assessing stakeholders’ perceptions to ensure efficient policymaking
AU  - Specht, Kathrin

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - Rooftop agriculture (RA) is an innovative form of urban agriculture that takes advantage of unused urban spaces while promoting local food production. However, the implementation of RA projects is limited due to stakeholders’ perceived risks. Such risks should be addressed and minimized in policymaking processes to ensure the sustainable deployment of RA initiatives. This paper evaluates the risks that stakeholders perceive in RA and compares these perceptions with the currently available knowledge, including scientific literature, practices and market trends. Qualitative interviews with 56 stakeholders from Berlin and Barcelona were analyzed for this purpose. The results show that perceived risks can be grouped into five main categories: i) risks associated with urban integration (e.g., conflicts with images of “agriculture”), ii) risks associated with the production system (e.g., gentrification potential), iii) risks associated with food products (e.g., soil-less growing techniques are “unnatural”), iv) environmental risks (e.g., limited organic certification) and v) economic risks (e.g., competition with other rooftop uses). These risks are primarily related to a lack of (scientific) knowledge, insufficient communication and non-integrative policymaking. We offer recommendations for efficient project design and policymaking processes. In particular, demonstration and dissemination activities as well as participatory policymaking can narrow the communication gap between RA developers and citizens.

AB  - Greenhouse aquaponics (GA) can serve as a sustainable food production method, potentially improving food and nutrition security in resource-constrained and hostile climatic zones such as Nepal's Himalayan region. Energy concerns, however, are one of the major barriers to GA adoption in this region. There is a lack of comprehensive energy demand analysis for GA operations. Therefore, in this study, an energy model for GA based on a quasi-static energy balancing technique was developed to estimate energy demand for the Himalayan region. The study was conducted in 19 districts with varied GA dimensions, and a linear-model was fitted to predict yearly energy consumption. Thereafter, relations to estimate the capacity of PV systems for supplying the required energy were devised. Eventually, this study proposes potential energy management strategies to reduce dependency on a single energy source, reduce energy loss, and enhance resilience to energy concerns. Findings suggest, heating the GA is a major energy concern, accounting up to 85% of the overall energy requirement. Thermal evaluation reveals that conduction and convection losses are the most significant, contributing up to 29.5% of total energy consumption. Moreover, this study testifies the effectiveness of thermal energy storage devices in achieving significant energy savings. The proposed energy management strategies can serve as a decision-making tool for optimizing the design and operation of GA. Furthermore, this research serves as a blueprint for addressing aquaponics related energy challenges worldwide, especially in areas with similar climatic conditions, such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region.

AB  - Smart sensors are useful in professional farming approach by which one can use the digital technology to monitor, visualize, generate digital data, to control the application of resources, to improve quality and productivity of agriculture produce. Novel sensors add value in soil-less farming through automation and IoT (Internet of Things) based operation management digital tools. Data-driven technologies by using smart sensors can find a solution to many glitches in agriculture practices and it could improve new efficiencies. The principles of smart sensors as well as the most viable sensors that are used for monitoring soil and plant physicochemical parameters in field cultivation processes, greenhouse and indoor hydroponics are being discussed. Digital technologies in precision farming, automation in agro machinery, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), TV White Spaces (TVWS) remote connectivity, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based imagery, application of IoTs can help farming communities to use resources accurately based on real-time farm data acquired and improve crop yield without any wastage. Smart sensors helps the entire food value chain, the precision to productivity quest of growers and could enable new business models. This article provides a wide understanding of novel smart sensors, wireless sensor network architectures, and applications of these sensors to inculcate sustainable farming practices, value chain traceability and create secured income.

AB  - Globally there are three major challenges in the 21st century, related to the conventional agriculture-based food production system. They are very suitably defined under the United Nations sustainable development goals. These three challenges are food security, nutrition security, and climate security. With ever-increasing global population, decreasing arable land area, soil erosion, and scarcity of freshwater availability, these challenges aggravate ecological homeostasis. Such interconnected challenges are of paramount importance and can be overcome by some extent through climate-smart agriculture practices such as the use of renewable energy sources to drive agriculture, crop diversification, crop rotation, and organic agriculture. However, the need of the hour is to leapfrog toward climate-resilient cultivation practices. Deployment of soilless indoor cultivation technology is one such long-term sustainable strategy. Adoption of soilless technology provides a great opportunity to produce more with less cultivation area, more crop per drop of water, reduction of the toxic chemical load, and improving the ecological footprint. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the impact of climate change on food security and nutrition security and how soilless cultivation technology can bring a paradigm shift to close the gap between food and nutrition security.

TI  - From Land Consolidation and Food Safety to Taobao Villages and Alternative Food Networks: Four Components of China's Dynamic Agri-Rural Innovation System
AU  - Martindale, Leigh
T2  - Journal of Rural Studies
AB  - The global food system currently requires a transformation in terms of both social and technological norms in order to be environmentally sustainable and productive enough to feed a growing global population. This paper suggests that China has the innovation regime that is the most capable of offering this transformation due the unique dynamic occurring between its top-down policy and bottom-up initiatives. Indeed, it is often the resulting spin-off developments, as a result of these two forces colliding, which creates interesting innovative trajectories that have a transformative potential. This paper identifies land consolidation as the policy most emblematic top-down agricultural process, food safety initiatives as the significant bottom-up equivilent and suggests that the rise of Taobao villages and rural e-commerce are the unintended innovative responses resulting from these forces. The dynamic of this innovation, I argue, can be tentatively mapped out to offer a grounded speculation of where, and how, the most intriguing, and perhaps most likely, developmental trajectories will occur regarding China's agricultural development. As such, this paper argues that Alternative Food Networks are one such evolving example and that the rise of ‘enterprise-based recreational agriculture parks’ - like Beijing's Xiedao Green Resort - points towards how particular innovative trajectories, through unique forms of scalar practices, could develop and shape, agricultural spaces in China.

AB  - The sustainability of agriculture is one of the most relevant issues if associated with the population increase expected in 2050. We need innovative strategies and tools far more effective compared to the current, to tackle this problem. Although the knowledge on the balance between the benefits and potential risk is under development, nanotechnology has the potential to enhance agricultural productivity and promote food security by a number of pathways. Crop fertilization is one of the most promising ones. This literature overview presents the state of the art on the use of nanoscale materials for plant nutrition, developed over the last 15 years. The nanofertilizers are classified into four groups: (i) macronutrient nanofertilizers, (ii) micronutrient nanofertilizers, (iii) nanomaterial-enhanced fertilizers and (iv) plant growth stimulating nanomaterials. Each group is discussed for its achievements and perspectives in new nanofertilizer. Much still remains to be done for sustainable global food security; however, the development of nano-enabled agriculture will have a decisive role in this challenge.

AB  - From farm to fork, food and beverage consumption can have significant negative impacts on energy consumption, water consumption, climate change, and other environmental subsystems. This paper presents a comprehensive, critical and systematic review of more than 350,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 701 studies, on the topic of greenhouse gas emissions from the food and beverage industry. Utilizing a sociotechnical lens that examines food supply and agriculture, manufacturing, retail and distribution, and consumption and use, the review identifies the most carbon-intensive processes in the industry, as well as the corresponding energy and carbon “footprints”. It discusses multiple current and emerging options and practices for decarbonization, including 78 potentially transformative technologies. It examines the benefits to sector decarbonization—including energy and carbon savings, cost savings, and other co-benefits related to sustainability or health—as well as barriers across financial and economic, institutional and managerial, and behavioral and consumer dimensions. It lastly discusses how financing, business models, and policy can be harnessed to help overcome these barriers, and identifies a set of research gaps.

AB  - There is a paucity of data on the state of urban agriculture soils. In order to develop efficient management practices, it is necessary to understand the seasonal dynamics of the soil health of these systems. This study sampled two community gardens, and one commercial urban agriculture site on a monthly basis over the span of one year. The dynamic analysis examined soil nutritional, chemical and microbial properties. Plant biodiversity was significantly higher in community gardens compared to commercial sites. Analysis of soil nutrients revealed fluctuations of mineral nitrogen with seasonal conditions and consistently high concentrations of plant-available phosphorus. We identified gradually decreasing soil total nitrogen and carbon concentrations throughout the year. Soils were abundant in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spores. Soil metabarcoding using 16S and ITS amplicons revealed a seasonal gradient of the microbial diversity and changes after the application of organic fertilizer. Soil-borne potential human pathogens were also detected in the soils. The results of this study provide relevant information about soil management principles in urban agriculture systems. These principles include mulching and the use of nutrient-balanced composts to counteract decreasing carbon pools and the excessive accumulation of phosphorus.

AB  - With increasing population, the demand for agricultural productivity is rising to meet the goal of “Zero Hunger”. Consequently, farmers have optimized the agricultural activities in a sustainable way with the modern technologies. This integration has boosted the agriculture production due to high potentiality in assisting the farmers. The impulse towards the technological advancement has revived the traditional agriculture methods and resulted in eco-friendly, sustainable, and efficient farming. This has revolutionized the era of smart farming which primarily alliance with modern technologies like, big data, machine learning, deep learning, swarm intelligence, internet-of-things, block chain, robotics and autonomous system, cloud-fog-edge computing, cyber physical systems, and generative adversarial networks (GAN). To cater the same, a detailed survey on ten hot-spots of smart farming is presented in this paper. The survey covers the technology-wise state-of-the-art methods along with their application domains. Moreover, the publicly available data sets with existing research challenges are investigated. Lastly, the paper concludes with suggestions to the identified problems and possible future research directions.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges in highly populated countries such as China and India is how to secure food supplies for the ever-growing human population. Farmland for agriculture has been declining due to fast urbanization that competes for land availability between agriculture and other economic sectors. In many arid regions such as northwest China, there are vast areas of nonarable or barren land. An overwhelming question is: can those nonarable or barren lands be used for cultivating crops for human food? Through a series of experimentation over years, an innovative cultivation system has been developed recently in China where clustered solar-energy, plastic-roofed, engineered facilities are built on nonarable to produce fresh vegetables year round, season after season. This cultivation system is called “facility agriculture,” “she-shi nongye” in Chinese pinyin or 设施农业 in Chinese characters. Using the facility cultivation system adopted in the northwest areas of China as an example, we provide readers with a general sense of the concept and definition of the “Made-in-China” cultivation system. We highlight recent developments in infrastructure and design, features and functionality, and vision and potential. We discuss some of the key scientific findings on the long-term viability and sustainability of this unique agricultural model. This industry is still in its infancy, so we cover some issues and problems facing the industry and suggest some key research areas for the near future. In 2014, the cropping area using the facility cultivation system reached 4.1 million ha, producing about 85% of all vegetables consumed in China and creating about 70 million jobs for rural communities. Thus, this industry has a vital role in ensuring food security while enhancing socioecological sustainability. The facility cultivation system is considered a revolution in Chinese agricultural history. We believe that this system has the potential to be adopted in other countries.

AB  - Maintaining the consistent provision of food is becoming a persistent challenge in the light of increasing demands for resources and the multiple risks governing food systems. These include population growth, market volatilities, changing climate and the lack of coordination amongst involved stakeholders. Dynamic and interactive simulation models have demonstrated their utility for developing possible scenarios related to the food sector's subsystems, allowing stakeholders to understand their outcomes, should they occur, and make efficient and sustainable decisions that potentially alleviate the risks. This study proposes an Agent-based model (ABM) that supports informed decision-making through allowing the simulation of multiple scenarios that can potentially influence the food system's strategies and actions. The framework is illustrated considering the economic actors within Qatar's food sector, with a special focus on delivering products in high demand, such as the tomato crop. The model was implemented using the Python-based Mesa library, and it simulates interactions between domestic farmers, local importers, and international exporters to assess the performance of the food sector considering economic, environmental and social scenarios. Scenario (1) describes the baseline case wherein local farmers and importers are acting independently with the aim to maximise their individual profits. Scenario's (2) and (3) represent enhancement plans that foster collaboration, water security and improved food quality. Findings of this study assert that from an economic standpoint, the food system can supply 75% of the market with imported tomatoes, as for the remaining 25%, it can be provided through national farms, with a 76% contribution of greenhouses and 24% open fields. This option offers the minimum economic cost and the lowest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. However, this perspective implies massive food losses and relatively high-water consumption. Scenario 2, which advocates a full reliance on imports offers a costly monthly strategy in terms of economic expenses and environmental emissions, however, it results in considerable water savings that relieve the strain on the local water supply system. When implementing a plan driven by quality consideration (scenario 3), the reliance on imports reaches up to 82%, and the remaining local produce is mostly supplied by greenhouses, with approximately 78%, leading to quality improvement and a substantial decrease in food losses yet at the expense of both the economic and environmental performance. These results confirm that aspiring water security and social welfare while provisioning food products requires tremendous investment and might lead to significant GHG emissions. The framework developed in this study provides a generic and interactive decision-making scheme that can assist in undertaking future decisions considering economic and environmental constraints and market-driven specifications.

AB  - In recent years, aquaponics has generated significant attention for recovery of resources (vegetables/fruits) from aquaculture effluent. Aquaponics produces organic vegetables by recycling nutrients in aquaculture effluent under a symbiotic environment among fish, plants, and bacteria. Linking the understanding of nutrient recycling processes to the productions is critical for designing and operating an efficient aquaponics. Due to high nitrogen concentration in aquaponics and aquaculture/agriculture systems, nitrogen is a key element to be considered for optimizing aquaponics to maximize nutrient use efficiency and minimize the environmental impact associated with nitrogen release. In this chapter, the background of aquaponic food productions and principle of nitrogen recovery are presented together with the basics of biochemical nitrogen transformations, as applied to aquaponic systems. In this chapter, we link nitrogen transformations to biochemical processes in fish, bacteria, and plants (e.g., ammonification in fish, microbial metabolisms, plant growth, and nitrogen cycle). Furthermore, a design example that is based on the principle of nitrogen transformations is also provided. Modern methods for studying microbial community in aquaponics and growth equations for predicting the aquaponics productions are also briefly presented for further research. Overall, this chapter provides necessary backgrounds for aquaponic growers to start and operate an efficient aquaponics system with brief information for advancing research and development in aquaponics.

TI  - Social innovation in alternative food networks. The role of co-producers in Campi Aperti
AU  - Alberio, Marco

T2  - Journal of Rural Studies
AB  - In recent years, alternative food networks are emerging as alternative solutions to the mainstream food industry. These innovative ways of producing, delivering and consuming food can lead to new opportunities but also challenges for social analysis. On the one hand, they reveal new reflexive and resilience capacities that show social actors’ creativity in re-organising their activities as a response to the recent socioeconomic transformations. On the other hand, the relations between producers and consumers are being reshaped through practices, narratives and actions from both the field of production and of consumption. Considering the prosumer as an emblematic figure of the current social economic configuration, which is strongly characterised by hybridisation, our paper explores the relation between contemporary social movements, social innovation and alternative food networks. Drawing upon the concept of social innovation conceived through a territorial approach, we will examine the locally embedded creative capacity of social groups in the field of organic food production, distribution and consumption. Empirical data from an Italian case study, Campi Aperti, will allow us to show how the issue of food sovereignty is addressed by small-scale local actors. In this paper, we use the case study to critically reflect on the rearrangement and networking of the producer-consumer relation and inter-action, as well as the constraints these actors experience. We conclude by illustrating how such local initiatives may contribute to the promotion of political activism able to transform collective voice into alternative social practices, hence creating new meanings and narratives.

Raw material extraction contributes a major impact in all the categories of life cycle analysis, whereas the manufacturing process leads to fossil fuel depletion. Furthermore, the cultivation of crops may contribute to global warming due to land-use change. The production unit and refrigeration consume high energy, which accounts for the depletion of the ozone layer. Finally, further development and improvement are required to combat the problems associated with ice-cream production.

AB  - Fresh fruit and vegetables are a major source of biologically active compounds essential for human wellbeing. They are, however, perishable living products that require coordinated actions by growers, storage operators, processors, and retailers to maintain their quality and reduce food loss and waste. Recent advances in shelf life extension have been achieved by the combination of treatments including suitable temperature, humidity, and gas composition that maintain their quality and safety. Fresh produce attributes such as appearance, texture, flavour and nutritional value have been traditional quality criteria, but increasingly safety and traceability are important for all the role players along the supply chain from the farm to consumer. Non-destructive techniques for analysing the quality of fresh produce are valuable tools applicable along the supply chain. Advances in optical methods were touched in this perspective article pointing to new methods to inform the user. Quality deterioration and microbial contamination leading to spoilage and postharvest losses can occur at any of the supply chain stages. Therefore, postharvest treatments are essential to minimise quality loss, microbial spoilage and reduce the risk of pathogen contamination. Various postharvest physical, chemical and gaseous treatments can be applied to maintain fresh-like quality without compromising the sensory and nutritional aspects. The consequences of these techniques on quality and safety of fresh horticultural commodities are highlighted in this paper. Future research should aim at improving organoleptic quality and meeting safety standards of fresh produce at all steps of the supply chain.

AB  - The use of hydrogels in academic research is fast evolving, and becoming more relevant to real life applications across varying fields. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has paved the way towards manufacturing hydrogel substrates with tailored properties which allow for new functionalities and applications. In this review, we introduce the idea of fabricating hydrogels as bioreceptive structures to be used as soilless cultivation substrates. AM is suggested as the fabrication process to achieve structures with features similar to soil. To evaluate this, we first review hydrogel fabrication processes, highlighting their key differences in terms of resolution, printing speed and build volume. Thus, we illustrate the examples from the literature where hydrogels were 3D printed with microorganisms such as algae. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of printing soilless cultivation substrates are explored.

AB  - This work represents a nanofluid spectral splitting (NSS) covering applied to the greenhouse roof to achieve the co-production of crops and energy harvesting. NSS is a hollow structure composed of highly light-transmissive rigid materials with 10 mm thick 0.005 vol% ATO-WO3 nanofluids circulating in the hollow layer with a flow rate of 400 L/h. To study the growth response of plants in the NSS greenhouse (NSS-G), plant cultivation experiments and photothermal tests were carried out. The energy analysis and performance estimation of NSS-G were proved. The results show that NSS-G can absorb 77.9% of the solar energy within 800–1500 nm wavelengths to generate heat. Compared with the conventional hollow covering greenhouse (Air-G), NSS-G can reduce the temperature of indoor air and plant leaves by 6.3 °C and 8.7 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, 76.6% of sunlight within 300–800 nm wavelengths is transmitted to plants for photosynthesis. The results of plant growth experiments showed that, in comparison with Air-G, the photosynthetic rate in NSS-G reduced by 6.5%, but plant dry weight was increased by 4.3% and there was no significant difference in biochemical component contents. It proved that it is feasible to use NSS as the covering of the greenhouse roofs, and the total solar energy utilization efficiency in NSS-G was more than 55%.

TI  - Understanding regional innovation cultures: Narratives, directionality, and conservative innovation in Bavaria
AU  - Pfotenhauer, Sebastian M.

T2  - Research Policy
AB  - In recent years, innovation policy has increasingly embraced “situated” perspectives to better account for both how culture matters for innovation in diverse settings and how to deal with growing socio-economic inequalities and conflicts in the global innovation landscape. In this paper, we develop the framework of “regional innovation cultures” to put these perspectives on more solid theoretical footing. Regional innovation cultures refer to unique ways in which regional innovation initiatives and technology developments (their goals, meanings, material organization, and actor constellations) are being brought into alignment with local identities, socio-economic legacies, and unique political cultures. Our framework foregrounds five analytic dimensions: imagined social orders, representations, political cultures, relationship to national and global initiatives, and local controversies. We apply this framework to one in-depth regional case study of the German state of Bavaria, focusing on innovation policy in three sectors: space, agriculture, and automotive. We show how Bavaria enacts what we call a “conservative innovation culture”, where innovation is framed as a way to preserve socio-economic orders rather than disrupt them, and where political and economic incumbents forcefully shape and absorb emerging niche activities. Innovation in Bavaria is performed through a political culture of small state-like corporatism that emphasizes strong coordination of all major actors, grants state bureaucracies a key role in defining directions for innovation in the form of a quasi-technonationalism, and tends to sideline alternative visions and voices for innovation. Across all three sectors, culture serves as a framing device to legitimize innovation primarily as an extension of existing social orders; conversely, innovation serves as a vehicle to reinforce dominant ideas of the public good. Through the lens of culture, innovation ceases to be primarily a source of social change and disruption, but can be understood as a mode of socio-cultural reproduction subject to tentative, constrained experimentation. Innovation initiatives cannot break too radically with existing social norms and orders without risking public support or legitimacy, thus creating a trade-off between proposing novelty and ensuring continuity. Our analysis lends further support for constructivist approaches to innovation studies, emphasizing plural and socially grounded perspectives on the rationalization, implementation, and evaluation of innovation.

AB  - There is a rapid increase in the adoption of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Internet of Underground Things (IoUT), Data analytics in the agriculture domain to meet the increased food demand to cater to the increasing population. Agriculture 4.0 is set to revolutionize agriculture productivity by using Precision Agriculture (PA), IoT, UAVs, IoUT, and other technologies to increase agriculture produce for growing demographics while addressing various farm-related issues. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of how multiple technologies such as IoT, UAVs, IoUT, Big Data Analytics, Deep Learning Techniques, and Machine Learning methods can be used to manage various farm-related operations. For each of these technologies, a detailed review is done on how the technology is being used in Agriculture 4.0. These discussions include an overview of relevant technologies, their use cases, existing case studies, and research works that demonstrate the use of these technologies in Agriculture 4.0. This paper also highlights the various future research gaps in the adoption of these technologies in Agriculture 4.0.

AB  - Increasing production to meet the growing demand for food whilst conserving biodiversity and reducing pressure on natural ecosystems is a dual planetary challenge of the highest order. The world’s small farmers are at the forefront of this challenge, being asked to make greater contributions to both enhancing food and nutrition security, and to the stewardship of natural assets. We focus on rewilding involving the conservation, management, and reintroduction of species, and how the praxis impacts small farmers in Europe, simultaneously being encouraged to increase food production. We present empirical data from four European case studies featuring Norwegian wolves, Scottish Sea Eagles, and wild boar in both Spain and Italy. We adopt Beck’s World Risk Society concept to situate what small farmers report as trade-offs, within a broader sociological schema, to show underlying features of a new landscape.

AB  - The postharvest phase of fresh produce is tightly regulated in terms of food safety (heavy metals, chemical contamination, and microbiological) and quarantine issues and rather loosely regulated in terms of attributes related to eating quality. These regulations are imposed at international and national levels, and within (private sector) value chains. In this chapter, the use and abuse of these regulations is reviewed, in context of consumer or producer “good.” As in all regulatory exercises, it is important that a common language is available, and the available languages are reviewed. Of these, Codex Alimentarius acts as a “common denominator” of food safety and quality specifications. However, specific value chains may regulate for higher levels of specification, for example, organic certification or GlobalGAP certification. The particular issue of eating quality is considered further in terms of available specifications and the drivers for adoption of standards based on these specifications.
