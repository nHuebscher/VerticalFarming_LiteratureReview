Such systems are capable of minimizing externalities due to resource recycling. There are two systems, apparently diverging, recently considered as the counterparts of today’s conventional agricultural practice: organic farming (OF) and plant factories (PFs). With a strong regulatory background, OF integrates plant production into natural ecosystems by minimizing agrochemical use, while PFs create an artificial environment where all factors can be fine-tuned according to the needs of the crop. In this study, both systems are investigated based on their similarities and constraints; for this, three pillars of production were selected as indicators and reviewed for sustainability based on literature data: I. regulatory background, II. growing media use, III. species use, along with certain socio-economic factors. The reasons for co-existence were highlighted in every aspect. Alternatives for sustainable growing media use are introduced. PF-targeted species selection and variety breeding are necessary to maximize facility utilization. The main barriers to system interoperability are identified in growing media use and regulatory restrictions. The present global processes envisage the trends of the future, such as threats of living ecosystems, plant species allocation, urbanization impacts, agricultural intensification, economics of PFs, local supply chains, education about OF and PFs, consumer acceptance of OF and PF products, and discrepancies in global regulations. These aspects will certainly trigger further research in the scientific community","2023","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, the conventional use of arable land is becoming increasingly difficult, which is further exacerbated by climate change. Soilless cultivation systems do not only offer the opportunity to save water and cultivate without soil but also the chance to open up urban areas such as residential rooftops for food production in close proximity to consumers. In this review, applications of soilless farming systems are identified and compared to conventional agriculture. Furthermore, aspects of economic viability, sustainability and current developments are investigated. An insight into the most important soilless farming systems—hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming—is provided. The systems are then differentiated from each other and, as far as possible, evaluated in terms of their environmental impact and compared with conventional cultivation methods. Comparing published data analyzing the yield of hydroponic cultivation systems in comparison to soil-based cultivation methods enables a basic overview of the profitability of both methods and, thus, lays the foundation for future research and practical applications. The most important inert substrates for hydroponic applications are presented, and their degree of sustainability is compared in order to emphasize environmental impacts and affect substrate selections of future projects. Based on an assessment of the most important soilless cultivation systems, the challenges and developments of current techniques are highlighted and discussed.","2022","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Continued population growth leads to rapid urbanization which results in a decline in arable land, ongoing global climate change, water shortages and could change our view of traditional farming to highly efficient urban farms. This project encompasses the design, construction, and evaluation of a soil based vertical farm. The vertical farm contained six plots in three vertically layers. Each layer of the vertical farm, was elevated 2 feet higher than the below layers. Red amaranth was grown on the vertical farm to investigate the growing rate and sustainability of red amaranth in vertical farm. Evaluations have been done on the yield production of red amaranth and compared with horizontal farm. Production is compared on the basis of growing time, crop weight, crop length, root zone depth etc. Statistical analysis of the yield production showed that there was significant difference in yield production between different layers, and with horizontal layers. Most quality yields were grown (number of leaves 9, plant height 15 cm, plant weight 3.5 gm) in the uppermost layer of the structure. Lowest yield production (number of leaves 7, height of plant 10cm, weight of plant 1.5gm) was observed in lower layer. The elevation of the different layers did cause a noticeable difference in growth due to variation in light exposure. It was seen that weed infestation was zero. Also, insect infestation was not noticeable. The system was capable of producing high-quality red amaranth. Moreover, the construction of this vertical farm can be done by anyone with reasonable tool experience and the right set of tools. The adaptability of the vertical farm is also expected to increase among the unemployed youth and farmers, entrepreneurs and will generate more employment.","2018","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, agricultural land is already lost due to urbanization infrastructure advancement, leading to farmland shortages. The artificial control of light, temperature, gases, and humidity allows indoor plant production. Vertical farming’s primary goal is to maximize crop output in a small space. Vertical farming has the potential to produce food in a climate-resilient manner while emitting no pesticides and fertilizers, additionally using reduced land and water than conventional farming. Vertical farming systems, particularly around heavily populated areas, can meet everyday consumer needs for fresh, nutritious products and, at the same time, also contribute to resilient food systems. This system at present grows a narrow crop range, such as vegetables, herbs, and fruits. However, successful vertical farming integration into conventional agriculture demands profitability improvement, efficient energy utilization, end-user acceptance, and communal policy. In the present chapter, vertical farming is discussed as an indoor multilayer crop production system, investigating future challenges in the area of plant growth, quality, environmental sustainability, automation, system control, and socioeconomic and policy-associated institutions must collaborate to make certain successful vertical farming and organic farming integration into future food systems.","2023","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comprehensive Life Cycle Analysis on the environmental impact of a vertical farm compared to …","","","","","http://essay.utwente.nl/83529/","It is expected that the population of the earth will keep rising in the coming decades, surpassing 9 billion in 2050. This rise in population causes pressure on agricultural land and food production, as well as global warming and resource depletion. In order to mitigate all these problems, food production per unit area has to be maximized and be as efficient and non-polluting as possible. Revolutionary techniques such as technological advancements in rural agriculture, greenhouses and urban agriculture are being studied to find possible solutions to the major problems at hand. One of these techniques in urban agriculture is called Vertical Farming (VF) - the urban farming of eatable crops inside a building with an ideal climate regulated by (semi) closed loop systems – and is believed to be the perfect solution to both the agricultural food problems and the climate change and resource depletion problems. To test this theory, this study creates and analyzes a fictive vertical farm in the state of Oklahoma USA, based on the local climate characteristics and peer-reviewed sources on vertical farming systems. With the use of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), the environmental impacts of the lettuce production in this farm are calculated and the results are compared to the rural agriculture of the same crop (located in California USA). This study shows that most of the claims made on the technique of vertical farming are in fact true. A vertical farm has a higher yield than rural agriculture, with more than 80 times the yield of open field agriculture, due to multiple harvests a year and a higher plant density, has a lower water footprint, with 18 times less water used, due to the semi-closed loop water system, has a lower freshwater pollution rate, with a eutrophication reduction of 70-90%, due to minor use of excessive fertilizers and has a major decrease in transport distance and thus a decrease CO2 emissions during transport. However, due to the large electricity demand to keep all high-end systems running in a VF, the CO2 emissions of a vertical farm are actually higher than that of rural agriculture. In fact, this high electricity use causes a lot of spikes in the graphs of almost all impact category, especially in the Terrestrial Acidification and the Land Footprint. Contrary to many beliefs, stating that the Land Footprint is only linked to the surface area in relation to plant density ratio, the Vertical Farm actually has a massive Land Footprint, due to the fact that electricity production and other production steps in the LCA also require a lot of land use. The results demonstrate that a Vertical Farm, just like any other agriculture technique, has its positives and negatives. Even though, it can help solve problems such as large food shortages and minimal water use, it has negative impacts elsewhere, in this case on land footprint, acidification of the ground and climate change. This study highlights the whole framework of a vertical farm and its characteristics, the positives and negatives of vertical farming and the importance of analyzing every step in a life cycle of a product or system. The thesis concludes by addressing the possibility of more efficient crop lay-outs and sustainable systems as well as the vertical farm’s potential in other fields of study such as extreme climates and aerospace.","2020","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: essay.utwente.nl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both concepts respond to the environmental damage caused by the abuse of pesticides and artificial fertilizers in conventional farming. Despite their current relatively small scale, their emergences are opening new paradigms for food production in Finland, which provide potential solutions to the environmental crises we are facing, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation. My master’s thesis combines ethnographic and action research to investigate permaculture and vertical farming practices and interpret sustainability from the perspective of food producers. By ethnographically studying routine, situated practices, the study investigates the values and knowledge embedded in both practices. The data originate from participant observation, interviews, and co-design workshops. Eco-modernism can be considered as the philosophical background of vertical farming. Although both public-facing discourses are built on the notion of environmental friendliness, permaculture and eco-modernism have drastically different perceptions of the relationships between human activities and nature. This work explores the mechanisms of permaculture and eco-modernism in practice. By comparing and contrasting permaculture with vertical farming, this thesis aims to reveal the complexity of sustainability. Multiple perspectives prevent the study from being constrained to one narrative. A relational ontology motivates the exploratory step to study the connection between permaculture and vertical farming through boundary objects. Two boundary objects were designed and utilised: growing media made of side streams; and mapping data on the geographical location of farms. Narrative analysis and thick description show the multiple layers of the concepts regarding sustainability, such as “local” and “organic”. Furthermore, the study shows that ethnographic research, co-design, and scientific exploration have great potential to benefit from each other. Further research includes more centralised research on how to identify and value the immeasurable contributions of farming practices.","2020","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: aaltodoc.aalto.fi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indoor vertical plant farming (VPF) is a novel form of agriculture offering space savings, water efficiency, and hyper-local production. A significant caveat is the associated CO2 emissions from energy consumption. We conduct a carbon life-cycle analysis of lettuce production comparing imports from a Spanish field-based farm with hydrogen fuel cell-powered vertical farm in a UK context. We examine the implications of energy source trade-offs and the effects of deforestation. Experimental data using blue hydrogen energy shows emissions for VPF as 3.79 kg CO2e kg-1 without and 4.45 kg CO2e kg-1 with the impact of deforestation considered. Associated emissions for field-based imported lettuce are 1.14 kg CO2e kg-1 and 5.05 kg CO2e kg-1 without and with deforestation, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of energy sources in VPF shows tidal energy reduces emissions to 1.57 kg CO2e kg-1 with deforestation considered, a third of the emissions from conventional agriculture. Wind, tidal and geothermal energies also show promise for low carbon footprints. The results show that VPF with renewable energy sources could provide a lower carbon footprint than imported lettuce from a field-based farm.

Given the observed, adverse impacts on wheat yields of climate change and the importance of wheat in the human diet, the purpose of this study was to use life cycle assessment to compare conventional wheat farming with indoor vertical farming using hydroponics. Methods: Life Cycle Assessment was used to assess the base case systems up to the “farm gate” for 1 tonne of wheat grain. The processes contributing most of the impacts were identified, and scenarios were assessed to determine how much the impacts could be reduced. Results: The conventional system outperformed the base case vertical system in every impact category, due to the electricity consumption in the lighting system. The scenarios included increasing the efficiency of the LED lighting and using 100% wind energy, but the conventional system still outperformed the vertical system by significant margins in all impact categories. This was due to the low photosynthetic conversion efficiency and the high energy density of wheat. Conclusions: Until significant improvements are made to lighting efficiency, the photosynthesis conversion efficiency of wheat, new wheat variants designed for vertical gardens and the sustainability of electricity supply, conventional wheat production will be environmentally preferable and vertical gardens would be advised to focus on food products with low energy densities.","2021","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: preprints.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Open-field agriculture and food distribution systems have a lot of food waste, and, in parallel, the largest percentage of available arable land is already occupied. In most cases, food produced by compatible agricultural methods needs to be frozen and travel several miles until it reaches the consumer, with high amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by this process, making it an unsustainable method with huge amounts of CO2 emissions related with fresh food products. This research contains an extensive literature review based on 165 international publications (from 2006–2022) describing and analyzing the efficiency and impact of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) methods, and more precisely, greenhouses (GHs) and vertical farms (VFs), in the environmental footprint of food production and consumption. Based on various publications, we could draw the conclusion that VFs could highly influence a greener transition to the sustainability of urban consumption with reduced CO2 emissions sourcing from food transportation and limited post-harvest processes. However, there is a significant demand for further energy efficiency, specifically when it comes to artificial lighting operations inside VFs. A large-scale implementation of VFs that operate with renewable energy sources (RES) could lead to significant urban decarbonization by providing the opportunity for integrated energy–food nexus systems. Under this direction, VFs could optimize the way that cities interact with meeting the food and energy demand in densely urbanized areas.","2022","2023-11-07 10:55:30","2023-11-07 10:55:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, it is substantiated that climate-smart agriculture plays an important role in ensuring the environmental sustainability of the agricultural economy, significantly increasing the resilience of agriculture to the risk of water scarcity and declining water quality, as well as to the risks of land degradation and declining soil fertility. However, the persistence of horizontal agriculture constrains the development of climate-smart agriculture and limits its contribution to the environmental sustainability of the agricultural economy. The prospects for environmental sustainability of the agricultural economy in the Decade of Action based on climate-smart agriculture are related to the transition to vertical farming.

A set of common baseline parameters and principles is proposed as a method of evolving a common structural framework for strengthening sustainability of agriculture and rural contexts. Concepts of rural-to-urban community sustainability are proposed, supporting sustainable agriculture contexts as rural and urban. In the twenty-first century, agriculture is becoming more diversified and less typified as a rural occupation. Urban agriculture is expanding as the need for fresh, affordable, accessible agriculture produce increases in urban areas. Evidence supports symbiotic relationships between sustainable agriculture and rural/urban communities, although some claim this relationship has not been clearly defined. This article investigates sustainable agriculture from two perspectives. We ask ‘what are common parameters and principles of the various forms of sustainable agriculture,’ and ‘why urban-to-rural context.’ Organic agriculture parameters and principles are proposed as a conceptual framework toward establishing baseline parameters and principles for sustainable agriculture. Best management parameters of urban and rural sustainable agriculture in the United States and the United Kingdom are examined for their potential to develop a strengthening framework of parameters and principles of agriculture and rural-to-urban sustainability.

The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk–benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.","2021","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plants need sunlight to survive, and soil to absorb water and nutrients from, so it's no surprise that a traditional farm is an outdoor farm. But as agriculture improved over the years, farmers gradually realized the benefits of farming indoors. All in all, it allowed certain crops to grow throughout the year. For another, it kept the crops free from pesticides. Vertical farming is the practice of producing in vertically stacked layers that involves large-scale agricultural production in multi-story buildings. Vertical farming is not just producing food indoors in an urban landscape, but it is a proposed solution to the pending food crisis our world is facing.","","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Closing the loop by recycling waste products into new resources is fundamental to sustainability, but the extent to which this should occur at local, regional, or global scales is an open question. We analyze how potential benefits and costs associated with urban agriculture scale with the extent of implementation, and compare potential tradeoffs in different metrics of sustainability. We assess how the appropriate metrics to optimize in a given city are context-dependent. For example, maximizing production in a small land footprint could be important in densely developed urban environments, whereas filling vacant land with food-producing gardens may be a more appropriate goal in certain post-industrial cities. We assess the potential role that urban agriculture plays in making urban food systems more resilient to climate change and other disruptions. Finally, we consider a case study comparing the resources required and pollution generated to produce the lettuce supply of on U.S. metropolitan area through outdoor urban agriculture and indoor urban agriculture, compared to conventional production and cross-continental transportation.

However, industrial farming has interdicted traditional cycle-closed farming approaches leading to a variety of environmental challenges. The contribution illustrates the basics of traditional gardening and farming approaches and describes how their characteristics are adapted in innovative modern farming systems like aquaponic, permaculture, urban farming, as well as recovered traditional farming systems. The approach to combine traditional farming methods with modern ones will provide multiple benefits in the future to ensure food security. There is to be underlined that such a strategy holds a substantial potential of circular flux management in small scale food production. This potential could be transposed to a larger scale also, particularly in terms of agroforestry and integrated plant and animal husbandry or integrated agriculture and aquaculture.

This mini review analyzes the evolutionary process of soilless cultivation within a vision of agriculture that supports environmental sustainability as the central theme of the discussion. Current knowledge suggests that, although apparently opposite, organic and high-tech soilless cultivation have several common or converging points in view of a sustainable use of resources on the planet. As a consequence, new policies should be oriented toward a reduction of environmental “pressure” by introducing a process certification of low environmental impact, which, together with an adequate product certification, related not only to the environmental aspect but also to product quality, can reduce the opposition of the two cultivation systems.","2021","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, following the industrial revolution in the mid-1800s, extensive deforestation, over-grazing of pastures and agricultural intensification have caused soils and the land resource base to become degraded. The increasing demands of a-growing population, leading to over-exploitation of natural resources, as well as, human-induced climate change imply major consequences for sustaining human health and habitation on Earth. In many part of the world, much of the cultivable land has been fully exploited, but the requirement of food and fiber production for meeting human nutrition and livelihoods continues to increases. Meeting these insatiable demands requires that farmers must produce more food, fodder and fiber from the same parcel of land. Hence, approaches and technologies for intensive cropping at scale without damaging the soil and land resource base is ever more vital for the survival of humans in the future. Conventional farming and livestock rearing practices resulted in decline of soil fertility, productivity and the general land quality while contributing to climate change due to net emission of greenhouse gases from soil and land. Therefore, a paradigm shift in sustainable soil as well as land management is undoubtedly required without delay. Regenerative agriculture involving holistic and integrated farming practices offer a promising solution. This approach includes agricultural practices that incorporate agroforestry, agri-slivopastoral systems, along with diversified cropping, as well as, soil and water conservation practices. Such restorative practices offer the possibility of numerous simultaneous benefits while preserving and enhancing the very resources that human societies depend on.","2022","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper assesses the potential of this ‘novel’ system for production in harsh climates with either low or high temperatures and solar radiation levels. The performance of plant factories is compared with cultivation in traditional greenhouses by analysing the use of resources in the production of lettuce. We applied advanced climate models for greenhouses and buildings, coupled with a lettuce model that relates growth to microclimate. This analysis was performed for three different climate zones and latitudes (24–68°N). In terms of energy efficiency, plant factories (1411 MJ kg−1 dry weight) outperform even the most efficient greenhouse (Sweden with artificial illumination; 1699 MJ kg−1 dry weight). Additionally, plant factories achieve higher productivity for all other resources (water, CO2 and land area). With respect to purchased energy, however, greenhouses excel as they use freely available solar energy for photosynthesis. The production of 1 kg dry weight of lettuce requires an input of 247 kWhe in a plant factory, compared to 70, 111, 182 and 211 kWhe in greenhouses in respectively the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates and Sweden (with and without additional artificial illumination). The local scarcity of resources determines the suitability of production systems. Our quantitative analysis provides insight into the effect of external climate on resource productivity in plant factories and greenhouses. By elucidating the impact of the absence of solar energy, this provides a starting point for determining the economic viability of plant factories.","2018","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced technologies and alternative food production methods such as vertical farming and hydroponic cultivation methods support the transition of conventional food production methods to more decentralized and local production systems. The development of high-tech urban agriculture is one of the strategies for more sustainable and resilient urban food systems, being explored by cities worldwide to feed their increasing population. Although urban agriculture has been widely studied, the process and consequences of technology driven transitions on urban planning and development are hardly understood. This paper uses the theory of Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) on sustainability transitions and Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore this technology driven transition and its adoption in urban planning and development. MLP describes transition as a process of change of the socio-technical regime, resulting from a combination of external pressure (the landscape) and internal pressure by innovation (niches). ANT describes the relations between human and non-human entities (actants) in the process of (de)stabilizing of the regime. The circumstances of configuration and reconfiguration of actants, including horticultural technologies, policy documents, land use plans, spatial development plans and decision makers, were studied Amsterdam and Shanghai were used as case studies. A comparative approach was used to analyse the role and relations of the various actants that were involved in the development and adoption of high-tech urban agriculture technologies in both cities. Studying the implementation of similar technologies in the different socio-political context of both cities allowed to identify the losses and gains in the process of transition and identify recommendations for policymakers, industry and other actors interested in bringing about change. The data were collected though observational research, document analysis and interviews. The research project studied socio-technical transition in three stages: 1- Disentanglement of incumbent socio-technical regime under pressure from landscape. 2- Punctualization process of novelties. 3- Reentanglement of punctualized actor-networks and creation of a new socio-technical regime. The results show that in Shanghai, the China Academy of Agricultural Science was a focal actant that used a top-down policy implementation approach to punctualize the high-tech urban agriculture practices into the socio-technical regime. In Amsterdam, the Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation (TKI) and Philips were the focal actant and the technologies that have been developed by Philips were obligatory passage point.

The demand for organic fruit and vegetables accounted for around 30%-40% of the global demand, but the total area for organic vegetable production was only 0.5% of the total area of vegetables grown in the world. Although it was generally considered that the output of organic agriculture was 10%-20% lower than that of conventional agriculture, it exceeded conventional agriculture in terms of economic benefits, environmental impact, and social benefits. It also had a positive performance in providing nutrition, adapting to climate change, promoting soil health, protecting biodiversity, increasing employment and creating new economic model. In the face of rapid population growth, climate change and environmental degradation in the 21st century, new organic greenhouse horticulture was the major force for sustainable agricultural development. The total area for organic greenhouse horticulture was estimated to be over 8302 hm² (1.8% of total vegetable greenhouse area). There were 5236 hm² in European Union and 3066 hm² in Non-European Union. With the rapid development of agriculture in the world, the organic greenhouse horticulture had been shown to be sustainable, productive and profitable in foreign countries, but the standards of organic greenhouse horticulture were still a blank in China. This paper introduced the background, definition, origin, objectives, area of organic certification, yield and profitability, the basic forms of organic greenhouse horticulture and the rules of certification, and analyzed the feasibility and problems on the organic greenhouse horticulture in China: 1) Certification standards of organic greenhouse horticulture were lacked. 2) Greenhouse ecological environment had been deteriorated. 3) Plant varieties for greenhouse were scarce. 4) There were only a few studies on organic greenhouse horticulture. The feasibility of the development of organic greenhouse horticulture in China was further analyzed. It was suggested that organic greenhouse horticulture should be actively developed in China, but organic greenhouse horticulture cannot be simply equivalent to ""greenhouse + organic planting"". It should be an integration with sustainable development, which consisted of greenhouse climate control, planting material, soil fertility, water management, disease and pest management, energy conservation and sustainability. However, to promote the development of organic greenhouse horticulture in China, we need to implement it based on national conditions and learn the rules of the foreign organic greenhouse horticulture. Moreover, the basic research of the biological agriculture in our country should be strengthened: 1) Strengthen the formulation of organic farming laws and industry standards in China, and point out the development goals and technical requirements of organic greenhouse horticulture. 2) Strengthen basic research in bio-agriculture to propose novel theories, technologies and equipment for protected agriculture. 3) Strengthen the development of agricultural machinery for organic greenhouse horticulture. The aim was to compensate for the lack of manpower, increase production efficiency and transform people's bias that organic agriculture has low yield and inefficiency. 4) Strengthen the demonstration and promotion of organic facilities horticultural technology integration. We need to construct a diversified organic facility horticultural extension service system with national public welfare promotion institutions as the main body, scientific research units, colleges and universities, agriculture-related enterprises, professional cooperative organizations and consumers participating in it. The system can provide information and technical services for farmers and consumers, which can ensure the sustainable development of the protected agriculture industry in China. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Furthermore, agricultural land is already lost due to urbanization infrastructure advancement, leading to farmland shortages. The artificial control of light, temperature, gases, and humidity allows indoor plant production. Vertical farming’s primary goal is to maximize crop output in a small space. Vertical farming has the potential to produce food in a climate-resilient manner while emitting no pesticides and fertilizers, additionally using reduced land and water than conventional farming. Vertical farming systems, particularly around heavily populated areas, can meet everyday consumer needs for fresh, nutritious products and, at the same time, also contribute to resilient food systems. This system at present grows a narrow crop range, such as vegetables, herbs, and fruits. However, successful vertical farming integration into conventional agriculture demands profitability improvement, efficient energy utilization, end-user acceptance, and communal policy. In the present chapter, vertical farming is discussed as an indoor multilayer crop production system, investigating future challenges in the area of plant growth, quality, environmental sustainability, automation, system control, and socioeconomic and policy-associated institutions must collaborate to make certain successful vertical farming and organic farming integration into future food systems.

Controlled-environment agriculture, in particular indoor vertical farming, is developing as part of this trend, to ensure a year-round supply of healthy food and protection from extreme weather events. However, high energy consumption is a major concern that could greatly impact the environmental sustainability of high-tech farms. Addressing the lack of comprehensive comparisons between different controlled-environment agriculture systems on a consistent basis, this work investigates the favourability of indoor vertical farms (i.e. plant factories) over modern ventilated open and closed greenhouses from an energy intensity perspective. This was based on a flexible yield-energy model incorporating detailed air conditioning system dynamics, which was developed to evaluate the influence of outside climate conditions on energy consumption and vegetable yield. The model was used to optimise the climate control strategy and to minimise hourly specific energy consumption for multiple systems, parameter settings, and locations. The hourly model performance is demonstrated for Stockholm, which indicates that advanced climate control allows for very low-energy operations in summer compared to winter. The results show a strong parametric sensitivity for the thermal transmittance of the cover, the target light intensity and the crop climate preference in all three systems, as well as the efficiency of lighting and water cooling for plant factories. Considering the yearly average for multiple locations, open greenhouses were substantially more energy-efficient than plant factories in all ten locations (from −45% in Reykjavík to −94% in Gauteng). The option to ventilate a greenhouse (open vs closed) had the greatest positive effect on specific energy consumption in less extreme climates (from −36% in Massachusetts to −83% in Gauteng) but increased water consumption considerably (from an average of ~2 l/kg to 26 l/kg). Although local availability of land and water plays a significant role in the choice between growing systems, the results imply that high-tech ventilated greenhouses perform significantly better than vertical farms from an energy perspective in most inhabited regions of the planet.

This work compares traditional farming with greenhouses and indoor vertical farming focusing on the challenges and the opportunities for each category. The scope of this work was to stress the role of indoor vertical farming towards this direction. Indoor vertical farms can produce high quality and virus-free products that can be locally distributed, inside the urban environment that such investments take place, saving annually millions of tons CO2 emissions. Beyond that, in this work it was pointed out how energy plays a role in food safety in such systems. It was stressed that indoor vertical farms can act as a demand response aggregator. In large scale units it could play a role to adjust their production according to different electricity prices offered in different time zones throughout the day. This way, the owners under a multi-value business model will create the opportunity to the vertical farm owners not only to improve their production but at the same time absorb inexpensive electricity offered, by creating an additional profit mechanism (multiple revenue streams) under such an approach by entering into contracts with companies in a utility electric region.

The Farm to Fork strategy approaches agriculture from a sustainable food systems perspective. Sustainable agriculture is also central in the European Biodiversity strategy, in the Long-term vision for EU Rural areas and in the Soil strategy. Despite clear policy objectives, there is still a long way towards an effective transition towards sustainable agriculture based on integrated, science based, solutions.; OBJECTIVE; This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the challenges and opportunities for the transition towards a sustainable agriculture in Europe, the role of European policies and practical approaches.; METHODS; We reviewed policy documents, scientific literature and global data to reflect on the vision of the Farm to Fork and other European strategies affecting sustainable agriculture, focussing on which policy instruments are foreseen to reach their objectives, which are the key-challenges related to achieve more sustainable farming, and on possible approaches to attain sustainable agriculture.; RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS; We provide an overview of synergies and shared objectives between different European policies and strategies aiming to support the transition to sustainable agriculture from environmental, social and economic perspectives. We identified several often reported challenges to attain sustainable food systems: reduced yields, increased land demand, nitrogen needs, changes in diet, food waste, distribution and access to food, and externalities to third countries. Finally, we discuss two main approaches to sustainable agriculture with potential complementarity to fulfil the objectives of sustainable agriculture as reflected in the different European policies and strategies. Sustainable intensification with focus on environmental- friendly production, and agroecology with focus on ecology, social justice and food sovereignty. We reflect on how both approaches can be integrated to create synergies and optimize delivery of multiple ecosystem services. The transformation to sustainable agriculture, as expected from the several revised strategies, is not just a technical question of farming practices, but requires a holistic approach considering social, economic, cultural, technical and environmental aspects. Local adaptations, stakeholder participation, and recognition that agriculture produces more than crops, are key to support this transition of agriculture and food systems.; SIGNIFICANCE; The transition towards more sustainable agriculture requires alignment of policies related to social, economic and environmental aspects, including social and economic acknowledgment to farmers, as managers of agroecosystems and cultural landscapes delivering a range of ecosystem services.; DA","2023","2023-11-07 10:55:31","2023-11-07 10:55:31","","103634","","","207","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agroecology; Biodiversity strategy; Farm to fork strategy; Green deal; Long term vision for EU rural areas; Soil strategy; Sustainable farming; Sustainable intensification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Farm to Fork Strategy asserts that research and innovation are key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems, from primary production to consumption. Therefore, in this paper, the most promising fields of innovation towards this transition in the agrifood sector have been reviewed with reference to the value chain actors engaged in their implementation. Although not exhaustive, this short survey presents a selection of solutions that have in recent years been viewed as ‘first mover’ opportunities for innovation in the agrifood sector where changes have been initiated but need to be further implemented. The paper first discusses options that allow agrifood businesses to operate directly as innovation providers, and then expands on the role of public stakeholders, namely consumers, policy makers and researchers, to act as agents of change and contribute to pave the way to a ‘green deal’ in Europe. The survey concludes by highlighting the possibility of developing integrated approaches to research and innovation to ensure the sustainability of the food system through cooperative actions engaging both private and public actors in the value chain.

Currently, there are around 7.5 billion people on the planet Earth, and it is estimated that the population will grow by over 12 billion, the majority of whom will be living in mega cities in 2100. This means we need to produce more agricultural food while the global temperature increases. Molecular agriculture, hydroponics, or aquaponics indoor production through sky farming and nursery businesses are among the current topics on feeding, the planet Earth. In this chapter, we revisit some sustainable systems and methods used in agriculture. Different strategies of sustainable agricultural systems and methods seek to develop a sustainable environment and food production to increase crop productivity and soil health. This reduce the impacts of global climate change, through the adaptation and building of crop resilience, as well as conserving biodiversity, capturing carbon in the soil, and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Sustainability can be defined as the avoidance of the depletion of natural resources to maintain an ecological balance at a certain rate and it finds its exact definition in the biological systems where there exists exchange, but no waste is produced. Sustainable agriculture can be defined as desired type of agricultural activity to supply society's food and textile needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. From this definition, it is clear to note that an agricultural system cannot be sustainable if it causes environmental damage. Therefore, the environmental sustainability of agriculture is related to the preservation, restoration, and improvement of all natural elements such as air, water, soil, and their proper recycling along with the biodiversity of plant, animal, and microorganisms. Environmental sustainability and sustainable agriculture include the intentional practice of maintaining (engineering or mimicking the nature) healthy soil; managing water wisely; reducing food waste; minimizing pollution of air, water, and soil; promoting biodiversity; reducing tillage; integrating pest management; integrating livestock and crops; adopting sustainable practices, while enhancing the quality of life for communities of agriculture. To date, several sustainable agricultural systems and methods have been developed. In this chapter we revisit several dominant sustainable agriculture systems and methods practiced in agriculture. Each system has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, we need to use more than one system in sustainable agriculture. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding the right balance between the need for food production and the preservation of environmental ecosystems. However, today's majority of conventional agriculture and biotechnology are in directions as in the 20th century and before which focused on only more productions. Production-oriented agriculture already caused significant global climate change, water scarcity, land degradation, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity including agrobiodiversity. Grafting was added to the list of methods that could be used in all systems as a method of sustainable agriculture. We also provided definitions for individual systems and briefly explained the most common methods.

First, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are not sufficiently focused on agriculture, leading to funding allocation issues. Second, a mismatch of agroecology with technology innovations may slow scaling agroecological farming. Lastly, agricultural diversification must move beyond organic landscapes and into conventional agriculture. As a solution, principles of NbS should be clear on agricultural integration. Moreover, stakeholder awareness must increase that agroecology does not necessarily conflict with agricultural technologies. Future agricultural models must apply measures such as agricultural diversification in conjunction with technology innovations to then ascertain an overall timely and successful implementation of the UNFSS call to action.

Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create tradeoffs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways.

This paper suggests that China has the innovation regime that is the most capable of offering this transformation due the unique dynamic occurring between its top-down policy and bottom-up initiatives. Indeed, it is often the resulting spin-off developments, as a result of these two forces colliding, which creates interesting innovative trajectories that have a transformative potential. This paper identifies land consolidation as the policy most emblematic top-down agricultural process, food safety initiatives as the significant bottom-up equivilent and suggests that the rise of Taobao villages and rural e-commerce are the unintended innovative responses resulting from these forces. The dynamic of this innovation, I argue, can be tentatively mapped out to offer a grounded speculation of where, and how, the most intriguing, and perhaps most likely, developmental trajectories will occur regarding China's agricultural development. As such, this paper argues that Alternative Food Networks are one such evolving example and that the rise of ‘enterprise-based recreational agriculture parks’ - like Beijing's Xiedao Green Resort - points towards how particular innovative trajectories, through unique forms of scalar practices, could develop and shape, agricultural spaces in China.

"SW3V4J3M","journalArticle","2023","Haslbeck, F","Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft und deren Umsetzbarkeit in Niederbayern und der Oberpfalz","","","","","","Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft ist das Schlagwort der Zukunft. In den Regionen Niederbayern und Oberpfalz spielt die Diskussion über einen Umschwung zur ökologischen Bewirtschaftung des bäuerlichen Betriebs eine große Rolle. Bayernweit haben rund 11.000 Betriebe diese Hürde bereits bewältigt und widmen sich einer ökologischen Erzeugung ihrer Produkte. Dieser Umschwung bringt jedoch kontroverse Diskussionen mit sich. Die Landwirte sind unzufrieden über neue Auflagen und die eventuelle Gefährdung ihrer Existenz. Einen weiteren Streitpunkt stellen die Geldförderungen durch die EU dar. Rund 68 % der Landwirte sind der Meinung, diese seien falsch eingesetzt oder unzureichend. Aus einem aktuellen Meinungsbild geht außerdem hervor, dass es den Landwirten durchaus wichtig ist, tier- und umweltfreundlich zu arbeiten. Die Möglichkeiten, dies zu tun, sind jedoch durch diverse Faktoren beschränkt. Um einen Querschnitt über die Möglichkeiten, aber auch die Probleme des bayrischen Agrarsektors darzustellen, werden im in dieser Arbeit sowohl die Umsetzung in der aktuellen Situation als auch Zukunftsaussichten der Landwirtschaft dargestellt. Die Landwirtschaft in Bayern polarisiert seit Jahrhunderten. Mit dem Ausruf des deutschen Kaiserreichs 1871 begann auch für die Landwirtschaft der erste Umschwung. Durch die fortschreitende Industrialisierung änderten sich auch die Anbautechniken sowie die Möglichkeiten Erträge zu maximieren. Der technische Fortschritt führte die Menschen zu Zeiten des Überflusses, aber auch in Zeiten von Klimakrise, Artensterben und einer Desensibilisierung gegenüber der Natur und Landwirtschaft. Die menschliche Weiterentwicklung zur Bewältigung dieser Probleme ist unabdingbar. Einen Lösungsansatz bietet der Gedanke ""Nachhaltigkeit"". In der Agrarwirtschaft erfüllt dieses Konzept jedoch eine besondere Rolle. Es ist die Art, wie Landwirte und Landwirtinnen mit den von der Natur geschenkten Ressourcen und Gegebenheiten umgehen. Auch der Verbraucher trägt einen großen Teil dazu bei. Er ist im Grunde der ""Arbeitgeber"" und hat die Möglichkeit, bestehende Strukturen und Abläufe zu beeinflussen.","2023","2023-11-07 10:55:32","2023-11-07 10:55:32","","","","Query date: 2023-09-12 11:59:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: GRIN Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the overall potential of UA to contribute to sustainable urban development has been extensively investigated, comprehensive analyses comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the various forms of UA are still scarce. In particular, the use of life cycle analysis (LCA) in quantifying the ecological sustainability of UA provides useful data for decision-making processes. The aim of this thesis is to close some of these research gaps by contributing to the emerging discourse on UA in the global north, with a focus on the city of Vienna, Austria. Different methodological approaches are combined in order to provide a comprehensive and detailed picture of the multifunctional potential of the analysed forms of UA. Important sustainability aspects and challenges to consider are shown: (i) a typology of seven relevant ideal-typical forms of UA in Europe is developed, systematically describing and comparing their concepts, goals and effects, as well as resource, energy and spatial requirements. (ii) On this basis, a systematic, multi-criteria sustainability assessment is carried out for each of the seven forms of UA. Starting with a comprehensive literature review, 39 sustainability indicators are defined, individually assessed and discussed with experts. In a third step (iii), an LCA is conducted to analyse the carbon footprint of 1 kg tomatoes from community garden projects in Vienna, a rooftop garden (RTG) and a project on a field (FP). The system boundary encompasses impacts from raw material extraction to the point of consumption and discerned four stages: substrate production, infrastructure, fertilizer management and soil tillage. The evaluated UA forms reach between 16 and 41% of the potential maximum urban sustainability value and form two clusters: (i) forms with a multifunctional character: community gardens and farms (37-41%) with potential benefits on social (e.g. community building and education), ecological (e.g. green infrastructure and recycling of organic urban waste) and economic (e.g. savings at the household level and establishment of alternative operating models) levels; and (ii) forms with more specific strengths: technically innovative forms of cultivation (16-18%) (e.g. food production, job creation as well as research and innovation). The differences are mainly due to the degree of multifunctionality along the analysed sustainability aspects. As the low overall values indicate, there is room for improvement as well as possible barriers and risks for all analysed forms of UA. The carbon footprints of the two case studies show considerable differences: compared to the FP system (60 g CO2e/kg of product), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the tomatoes produced in the RTG system are almost four times higher (221 g CO2e/kg of product). The difference is mainly caused by the use of compost substrate in the RTG system, which alone exceeds the total emissions of FP tomatoes by a factor of 2.3, thus representing a significant GHG hotspot in the production of RTG tomatoes. The results are within the range of comparable urban and organic production systems, which indicates that community-based UA projects – in addition to their socio-ecological benefits – could play a vital role in mitigating GHG emissions related to urban fruit and vegetable consumption in Vienna. With a comprehensive understanding of how the different forms of UA potentially contribute to overcoming major socio-ecological challenges in cities (such as the climate crisis and increasing urbanization) the present study can support urban policy-makers and stakeholders in integrating UA into city-wide development strategies and planning tools.","2020","2023-11-07 10:55:32","2023-11-07 10:55:32","","","","1 cites: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6924869766268133818&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=2007&hl=en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: researchgate.net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both of these food chain innovation are like-minded but rarely exchange ideas and results. Novel foods mushrooms, invertebrates, algae) and food habits (vegan, vegetarian, etc.) are popular in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture is very efficient in space (yield per m2) and nutrients (nearly 100%, closed systems). Organic can learn a lot about those ideas and results. Vis-a-versa, urban agriculture is limited in mass production, usually high-tech related with a lot of energy and technology needs.
