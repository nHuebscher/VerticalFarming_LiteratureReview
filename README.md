# Resources for Systematic Literature Review on the Sustainability of Vertical Farming 

## Tools and Sources used for the Literature review
The literature review (LR) was performed following the steps in the guideline of Silva and Neiva [1]. Inspired by [2], a few research tools were used for organizing and searching.

### Tools
- [Cadima](https://www.cadima.info/index.php), a tool for conducting a systematic literature review [3], [4]
    - Note: if you would like to get more insight in the project I did set up and how I classified which paper, it is possible to create your own account (for free) on Cadima and then I can add you as a member of my project
- [Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish), a tool simplifying searching for literature [5] which I used for Scopus and Google Scholar
- [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/), a tool showing connections between a set of papers and helping to find fitting others
    - Note: There is a Zotero Integration which can be very helpful if you use the Zotero online library
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for organizing literature

## Research Question, Design and Search Strings
- Research Question of the LR: How sustainable is producing different goods in vertical farming in comparison to open-field farming in the same climate zone as Germany (assessed in life cycle assessments to measure the environmental impact)?
- Research Design for LR search
    - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) are preferred to answer the question of environmental sustainability in the research design, however, social and economic sustainability will be considered as well. Therefore a broad definition of sustainability in the search strings is needed
    - Since there is not enough data for Germany, data from the same climate zone as Germany is considered (and explained in more detail in the following)
    - The term "open-field farming" is sometimes also specified as "conventional farming" or other versions. However, in English, for only the term "farming" there are to many results that do not fit the research design. In German, the term "Landwirtschaft" is fitting.
- Search Strings
    - English: ("Life Cycle Assessment" OR Sustainability OR Sustainable) AND ("Conventional farming“ OR "organic farming" OR "open-field farming") AND ("Vertical Farming" OR "Vertical Farm" OR "Plant Factory")
    - German: (Nachhaltigkeit OR Nachhaltig) AND Landwirtschaft AND ("Vertical farming" OR "Vertical Farm")

      
## Search Engine Results
- Manually added paper found using ResearchRabbit and checking Umweltbundesamt and Thünen-Institut
